<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Although <a href="/d/bharata" class="d">Bharata</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> was very elevated, he fell down due to his attachment to a young deer. One day after <a href="/d/bharata" class="d">Bharata</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> had taken his bath as usual in the River Ga&#7751;&#7693;ak&#299; and was chanting his <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/mantra" class="d">mantra</a>,</span> he saw a pregnant deer come to the river to drink water. Suddenly there could be heard the thundering roar of a lion, and the deer was so frightened that it immediately gave birth to its calf. It then crossed the river, but died immediately thereafter. <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/bharata" class="d">Bharata</a> took compassion upon the motherless calf, rescued it from the water, took it to his <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/asrama" class="d">&#257;&#347;rama</a></span> and cared for it affectionately. He gradually became attached to this young deer and always thought of it affectionately. As it grew up, it became <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> Bharata&rsquo;s constant companion, and he always took care of it. Gradually he became so absorbed in thinking of this deer that his mind became agitated. As he became more attached to the deer, his devotional service slackened. Although he was able to give up his opulent kingdom, he became attached to the deer. Thus he fell down from his mystic <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> practice. Once when the deer was absent, <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/bharata" class="d">Bharata</a> was so disturbed that he began to search for it. While searching and lamenting the deer&rsquo;s absence, <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/bharata" class="d">Bharata</a> fell down and died. Because his mind was fully absorbed thinking of the deer, he naturally took his next birth from the womb of a deer. However, because he was considerably advanced spiritually, he did not forget his past activities, even though he was in the body of a deer. He could understand how he had fallen down from his exalted position, and remembering this, he left his mother deer and again went to <a href="/d/pulaha" class="d">Pulaha</a>-<a href="/d/asrama" class="d">&#257;&#347;rama</a>. He finally ended his fruitive activities in the form of a deer, and when he died he was released from the deer&rsquo;s body.</div>
