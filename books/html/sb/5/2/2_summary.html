<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">In this chapter, the character of <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> &#256;gn&#299;dhra is described. When <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/priyavrata" class="d">Priyavrata</a> went off for spiritual realization, his son &#256;gn&#299;dhra became the ruler of <a href="/d/jambudvipa" class="d">Jamb&#363;dv&#299;pa</a>, in accordance with <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> Priyavrata&rsquo;s instructions, and maintained its residents with the same affection a father feels for his sons. Once <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> &#256;gn&#299;dhra desired to have a son, and therefore he entered a cave of <a href="/d/mandara" class="d">Mandara</a> Mountain to practice austerity. Understanding his desire, Lord <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> sent a celestial girl named P&#363;rvacitti to &#256;gn&#299;dhra&rsquo;s hermitage. After dressing herself very attractively, she presented herself before him with various feminine movements, and &#256;gn&#299;dhra was naturally attracted to her. The girl&rsquo;s actions, expressions, smile, sweet words and moving eyes were fascinating to him. &#256;gn&#299;dhra was expert in flattery. Thus he attracted the celestial girl, who was pleased to accept him as her husband because of his mellifluous words. She enjoyed royal happiness with &#256;gn&#299;dhra for many years before returning to her abode in the heavenly planets. In her womb &#256;gn&#299;dhra begot nine sons&mdash;<a href="/d/nabhi" class="d">N&#257;bhi</a>, <a href="/d/kimpurusa" class="d">Ki&#7745;puru&#7779;a</a>, Harivar&#7779;a, <a href="/d/ilavrta" class="d">Il&#257;v&#7771;ta</a>, <a href="/d/ramyaka" class="d">Ramyaka</a>, <a href="/d/hiranmaya" class="d">Hira&#7751;maya</a>, <a href="/d/kuru" class="d">Kuru</a>, <a href="/d/bhadrasva" class="d">Bhadr&#257;&#347;va</a> and <a href="/d/ketumala" class="d">Ketum&#257;la</a>. He gave them nine islands with names corresponding to theirs. &#256;gn&#299;dhra, however, his senses unsatisfied, was always thinking of his celestial wife, and therefore in his next life he was born in her celestial planet. After the death of &#256;gn&#299;dhra, his nine sons married nine daughters of <a href="/d/meru" class="d">Meru</a> named Merudev&#299;, <a href="/d/pratirupa" class="d">Pratir&#363;p&#257;</a>, Ugrada&#7745;&#7779;&#7789;r&#299;, <a href="/d/lata" class="d">Lat&#257;</a>, <a href="/d/ramya" class="d">Ramy&#257;</a>, &#346;y&#257;m&#257;, <a href="/d/nari" class="d">N&#257;r&#299;</a>, <a href="/d/bhadra" class="d">Bhadr&#257;</a> and Devav&#299;ti.</div>
