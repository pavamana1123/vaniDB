<div class="Translation">Although King <a href="/d/gaya" class="d">Gaya</a> had no personal desire for sense gratification, all his desires were fulfilled by virtue of his performance of Vedic rituals. All the kings with whom <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/gaya" class="d">Gaya</a> had to fight were forced to fight on religious principles. They were very satisfied with his fighting, and they would present all kinds of gifts to him. Similarly, all the br&#257;hma&#7751;as in his kingdom were very satisfied with King Gaya&rsquo;s munificent charities. Consequently the br&#257;hma&#7751;as contributed a sixth of their pious activities for King Gaya&rsquo;s benefit in the next life.</div>

<div class="First">As a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/ksatriya" class="d">k&#7779;atriya</a></span> or emperor, <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/gaya" class="d">Gaya</a> sometimes had to fight with subordinate kings to maintain his government, but the subordinate kings were not dissatisfied with him because they knew that he fought for religious principles. Consequently they accepted their subordination and offered all kinds of gifts to him. Similarly, the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> who performed Vedic rituals were so satisfied with the King that they very readily agreed to part with a sixth of their pious activities for his benefit in the next life. Thus the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas</span> were all satisfied with <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/gaya" class="d">Gaya</a> because of his proper administration. In other words. <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/gaya" class="d">Gaya</a> satisfied the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/ksatriya" class="d">k&#7779;atriya</a></span> kings by his fighting and satisfied the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> by his charities. The <span class="Italic">vai&#347;yas</span> were also encouraged by kind words and affectionate dealings, and due to <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> Gaya&rsquo;s constant sacrifices, the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span> were satisfied by sumptuous food and charity. In this way <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/gaya" class="d">Gaya</a> kept all the citizens very satisfied. When <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and saintly persons are honored, they part with their pious activities, giving them to those who honor them and render them service. Therefore, as stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/4/34?d=1">4.34</a>), <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/tad" class="d">tad</a> <a href="/d/viddhi" class="d">viddhi</a> <a href="/d/pranipatena" class="d">pra&#7751;ip&#257;tena</a> <a href="/d/pariprasnena" class="d">paripra&#347;nena</a> <a href="/d/sevaya" class="d">sevay&#257;</a>:</span> one should try to approach a spiritual master submissively and render service unto him.</div>
