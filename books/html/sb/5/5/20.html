<div class="Translation">My dear boys, you are all born of My heart, which is the seat of all spiritual qualities. Therefore you should not be like materialistic and envious men. You should accept your eldest brother, <a href="/d/bharata" class="d">Bharata</a>, who is exalted in devotional service. If you engage yourselves in Bharata&rsquo;s service, your service to him will include My service, and you will rule the citizens automatically.</div>

<div class="First">In this verse the word <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/hrdaya" class="d">h&#7771;daya</a></span> indicates the heart, which is also called <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/urah" class="d">ura&#7717;</a>,</span> the chest. The heart is situated within the chest, and although instrumentally the son is born with the aid of the genitals, he is actually born from within the heart. According to the heart&rsquo;s situation. the semen takes the form of a body. Therefore according to the Vedic system, when one begets a child his heart should be purified through the ritualistic ceremony known as <span class="Italic">garbh&#257;dh&#257;na.</span> &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva&rsquo;s heart was always uncontaminated and spiritual. Consequently all the sons born from the heart of &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva were spiritually inclined. Nonetheless. &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva suggested that His eldest son was superior, and He advised the others to serve him. All the brothers of <a href="/d/bharata" class="d">Bharata</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> were advised by &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva to adhere to Bharata&rsquo;s service. The question may be asked why one should be attached to family members, for in the beginning it was advised that one should not be attached to home and family. However, it is also advised, <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/mahiyasam" class="d">mah&#299;yas&#257;m</a> <a href="/d/pada" class="d">p&#257;da</a>-<a href="/d/rajo" class="d">rajo</a>-&rsquo;bhi&#7779;eka</span>&mdash;one has to serve the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/mahiyan" class="d">mah&#299;y&#257;n</a>,</span> one who is very spiritually advanced. <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/mahat" class="d">Mahat</a>-<a href="/d/sevam" class="d">sev&#257;&#7745;</a> <a href="/d/dvaram" class="d">dv&#257;ram</a> &#257;hur <a href="/d/vimukteh" class="d">vimukte&#7717;</a>:</I> [SB </span></I><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/5/5/2?d=1">5.5.2</a>] by serving the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/mahat" class="d">mahat</a>,</span> the exalted devotee, one&rsquo;s path for liberation is open. The family of &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva should not be compared to an ordinary materialistic family. <a href="/d/bharata" class="d">Bharata</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a>, &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva&rsquo;s eldest son, was specifically very exalted. For this reason the other sons were advised to serve him for his pleasure. That was to be their duty.</div>
<A NAME="68236"></A><div id="68236"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The Supreme Lord was advising <a href="/d/bharata" class="d">Bharata</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> to be the chief ruler of the planet. This is the real plan of the Supreme Lord. In the Battle of <a href="/d/kuruksetra" class="d">Kuruk&#7779;etra</a>, we find that Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> wanted <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/yudhisthira" class="d">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira</a> to be the supreme emperor of this planet. He never wanted Duryodhana to take the post. As stated in the previous verse, Lord &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva&rsquo;s heart is <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/hrdayam" class="d">h&#7771;daya&#7745;</a> <a href="/d/yatra" class="d">yatra</a> <a href="/d/dharmah" class="d">dharma&#7717;</a>.</span> The characteristic <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/dharma" class="d">dharma</a></span> is also explained in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a>:</span> surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. To protect <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/dharma" class="d">dharma</a></span> (<span class="Italic"><a href="/d/paritranaya" class="d">paritr&#257;&#7751;&#257;ya</a> <a href="/d/sadhunam" class="d">s&#257;dh&#363;n&#257;m</a></span>), the Lord always wants the ruler of the earth to be a devotee. Then everything goes on nicely for the benefit of everyone. As soon as a demon rules the earth, everything becomes chaotic. At the present moment, the world is inclined toward the democratic process, but the people in general are all contaminated by the modes of passion and ignorance. Consequently they cannot select the right person to head the government. The president is selected by the votes of ignorant <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras;</span> therefore another <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sudra" class="d">&#347;&#363;dra</a></span> is elected, and immediately the entire government becomes polluted. If people strictly followed the principles of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a>,</span> <span class="Italic"></I>they</span></I> would elect a person who is the Lord&rsquo;s devotee. Then automatically there would be good government. &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva therefore recommended <a href="/d/bharata" class="d">Bharata</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> as the emperor of this planet. Serving a devotee means serving the Supreme Lord, for a devotee always represents the Lord. When a devotee is in charge, the government is always congenial and beneficial for everyone.</div>
