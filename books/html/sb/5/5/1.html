<div class="Translation">Lord &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva told His sons: My dear boys, of all the living entities who have accepted material bodies in this world, one who has been awarded this human form should not work hard day and night simply for sense gratification, which is available even for dogs and hogs that eat stool. One should engage in penance and austerity to attain the divine position of devotional service. By such activity, one&rsquo;s heart is purified, and when one attains this position, he attains eternal, blissful life, which is transcendental to material happiness and which continues forever.</div>

<div class="First">In this verse Lord &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva tells His sons about the importance of human life. The word <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/deha" class="d">deha</a>-<a href="/d/bhak" class="d">bh&#257;k</a></span> refers to anyone who accepts a material body, but the living entity who is awarded the human form must act differently from animals. Animals like dogs and hogs enjoy sense gratification by eating stool. After undergoing severe hardships all day, human beings are trying to enjoy themselves at night by eating, drinking, having sex and sleeping. At the same time, they have to properly defend themselves. However, this is not human civilization. Human life means voluntarily practicing suffering for the advancement of spiritual life. There is, of course, suffering in the lives of animals and plants, which are suffering due to their past misdeeds. However, human beings should voluntarily accept suffering in the form of austerities and penances in order to attain the divine life. After attaining the divine life, one can enjoy happiness eternally. After all, every living entity is trying to enjoy happiness, but as long as one is encaged in the material body, he has to suffer different kinds of misery. A higher sense is present in the human form. We should act according to superior advice in order to attain eternal happiness and go back to Godhead.</div>

<div class="Purport">It is significant in this verse that the government and the natural guardian, the father, should educate subordinates and raise them to <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness. Devoid of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness, every living being suffers in this cycle of birth and death perpetually. To relieve them from this bondage and enable them to become blissful and happy, <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">bhakti</a>-<a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> should be taught. A foolish civilization neglects to teach people how to rise to the platform of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">bhakti</a>-<a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a>.</span> Without <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness a person is no better than a hog or dog. The instructions of &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva are very essential at the present moment. People are being educated and trained to work very hard for sense gratification, and there is no sublime aim in life. A man travels to earn his livelihood, leaving home early in the morning, catching a local train and being packed in a compartment. He has to stand for an hour or two in order to reach his place of business. Then again he takes a bus to get to the office. At the office he works hard from nine to five; then he takes two or three hours to return home. After eating, he has sex and goes to sleep. For all this hardship, his only happiness is a little sex. <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yan" class="d">Yan</a> maithun&#257;di-<a href="/d/grhamedhi" class="d">g&#7771;hamedhi</a>-<a href="/d/sukham" class="d">sukha&#7745;</a> <a href="/d/hi" class="d">hi</a> <a href="/d/tuccham" class="d">tuccham</a></I> [SB </span></I><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/7/9/45?d=1">7.9.45</a>]<span class="Italic">.</span> &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva clearly states that human life is not meant for this kind of existence, which is enjoyed even by dogs and hogs. Indeed, dogs and hogs do not have to work so hard for sex. A human being should try to live in a different way and should not try to imitate dogs and hogs. The alternative is mentioned. Human life is meant for <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/tapasya" class="d">tapasya</a>,</span> austerity and penance. By <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/tapasya" class="d">tapasya</a>,</span> one can get out of the material clutches. When one is situated in <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness, devotional service, his happiness is guaranteed eternally. By taking to <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">bhakti</a>-<a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a>,</span> devotional service, one&rsquo;s existence is purified. The living entity is seeking happiness life after life, but he can make a solution to all his problems simply by practicing <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">bhakti</a>-<a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a>.</span> Then he immediately becomes eligible to return home, back to Godhead.
