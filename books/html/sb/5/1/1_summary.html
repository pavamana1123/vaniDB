<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level"><JD:"Destination-1317">This chapter describes how King <a href="/d/priyavrata" class="d">Priyavrata</a> enjoyed royal opulence and majesty and then returned to full knowledge. King <a href="/d/priyavrata" class="d">Priyavrata</a> was detached from worldly opulence, and then he became attached to his kingdom, but finally he again became detached from material enjoyment and thus achieved liberation. When King <a href="/d/pariksit" class="d">Par&#299;k&#7779;it</a> heard about this, he was struck with wonder, but he was somewhat bewildered as to how a devotee with no attachment for material enjoyment could later become attached to it. Thus in astonishment he questioned &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; about this.</div>
</div><A NAME="66572"></A><div id="66572"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level"><TB>In response to the King&rsquo;s inquiries, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; said that devotional service, being transcendental, cannot be deviated by any material influences. <a href="/d/priyavrata" class="d">Priyavrata</a> had received transcendental knowledge from the instructions of <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a>, and therefore he did not want to enter a materialistic life of enjoyment in a kingdom. He accepted the kingdom, however, at the request of such superior demigods as Lord <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> and Lord <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a>, the King of heaven.</div>
</div><A NAME="66573"></A><div id="66573"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level"><TB>Everything is under the control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the supreme controller, and everyone must work accordingly. Just as a bull is controlled by a rope tied to its nose, so all conditioned souls are forced to work under the spells of the modes of nature. A civilized man, therefore, works according to the institution of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/varna" class="d">var&#7751;a</a></span> and <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/asrama" class="d">&#257;&#347;rama</a>.</span> Even in materialistic life, however, no one is free to act. Everyone is compelled to accept a certain type of body offered by the Supreme Lord and thus be allotted different grades of happiness and distress. Therefore even if one artificially leaves home and goes to the forest, he again becomes attached to materialistic life. Family life is compared to a fortress for practicing sense control. When the senses are controlled. one may live either at home or in the forest; there is no difference.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level"><TB>When <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/priyavrata" class="d">Priyavrata</a>, following the instruction of Lord <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a>. accepted the royal throne, his father, <a href="/d/manu" class="d">Manu</a>, left home for the forest. <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/priyavrata" class="d">Priyavrata</a> then married <a href="/d/barhismati" class="d">Barhi&#7779;mat&#299;</a>, the daughter of <a href="/d/visvakarma" class="d">Vi&#347;vakarm&#257;</a>. In the womb of <a href="/d/barhismati" class="d">Barhi&#7779;mat&#299;</a> he begot ten sons, named &#256;gn&#299;dhra, <a href="/d/idhmajihva" class="d">Idhmajihva</a>, <a href="/d/yajnabahu" class="d">Yaj&ntilde;ab&#257;hu</a>, Mah&#257;v&#299;ra, <a href="/d/hiranyareta" class="d">Hira&#7751;yaret&#257;</a>, <a href="/d/ghrtaprstha" class="d">Gh&#7771;tap&#7771;&#7779;&#7789;ha</a>, <a href="/d/savana" class="d">Savana</a>, <a href="/d/medhatithi" class="d">Medh&#257;tithi</a>, <a href="/d/vitihotra" class="d">V&#299;tihotra</a> and <a href="/d/kavi" class="d">Kavi</a>. He also begot one daughter, whose name was &#362;rjasvat&#299;. <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/priyavrata" class="d">Priyavrata</a> lived with his wife and family for many thousands of years. The impressions from the rims of <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> Priyavrata&rsquo;s chariot wheels created seven oceans and seven islands. Of the ten sons of <a href="/d/priyavrata" class="d">Priyavrata</a>, three sons named <a href="/d/kavi" class="d">Kavi</a>, Mah&#257;v&#299;ra and <a href="/d/savana" class="d">Savana</a> accepted <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sannyasa" class="d">sanny&#257;sa</a>,</span> the fourth order of life, and the remaining seven sons became the rulers of the seven islands. <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/priyavrata" class="d">Priyavrata</a> also had a second wife, in whom he begot three sons named <a href="/d/uttama" class="d">Uttama</a>, Raivata and <a href="/d/tamasa" class="d">T&#257;masa</a>. All of them were elevated to the post of <a href="/d/manu" class="d">Manu</a>. &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; thus described how <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/priyavrata" class="d">Priyavrata</a> achieved liberation.</div>
