<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">In this chapter &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; describes the different <span class="Italic">var&#7779;as</span> of <a href="/d/jambudvipa" class="d">Jamb&#363;dv&#299;pa</a> and the incarnation of the Supreme Lord worshiped in each. The predominating ruler of <a href="/d/bhadrasva" class="d">Bhadr&#257;&#347;va</a>-<a href="/d/varsa" class="d">var&#7779;a</a> is Bhadra&#347;rav&#257;. He and his many servants always worship the incarnation known as Lord <a href="/d/hayagriva" class="d">Hayagr&#299;va</a>. At the end of each <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/kalpa" class="d">kalpa</a>,</span> when the demon <a href="/d/ajnana" class="d">Aj&ntilde;&#257;na</a> steals the Vedic knowledge, Lord <a href="/d/hayagriva" class="d">Hayagr&#299;va</a> appears and preserves it. Then He delivers it to Lord <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a>. In the land known as <a href="/d/hari" class="d">Hari</a>-<a href="/d/varsa" class="d">var&#7779;a</a>, the exalted devotee <a href="/d/prahlada" class="d">Prahl&#257;da</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> worships Lord N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva. (The appearance of Lord N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva is described in the Seventh Canto of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a>.</span>) Following in the footsteps of <a href="/d/prahlada" class="d">Prahl&#257;da</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a>, the inhabitants of <a href="/d/hari" class="d">Hari</a>-<a href="/d/varsa" class="d">var&#7779;a</a> always worship Lord N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva to receive from Him the benediction of being engaged in His loving service. In the tract of land known as <a href="/d/ketumala" class="d">Ketum&#257;la</a>-<a href="/d/varsa" class="d">var&#7779;a</a>, the Supreme Personality of Godhead (Lord <a href="/d/hrsikesa" class="d">H&#7771;&#7779;&#299;ke&#347;a</a>) appears in the form of Cupid. The goddess of fortune and the demigods living there engage in His service day and night. Manifesting Himself in sixteen parts, Lord <a href="/d/hrsikesa" class="d">H&#7771;&#7779;&#299;ke&#347;a</a> is the source of all encouragement, strength and influence. The conditioned living entity has the defect of being always fearful, but simply by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he can rid himself of this defect of material life. Therefore the Lord alone can be addressed as master. In the tract of land known as <a href="/d/ramyaka" class="d">Ramyaka</a>-<a href="/d/varsa" class="d">var&#7779;a</a>, <a href="/d/manu" class="d">Manu</a> and all the inhabitants worship Matsyadeva to this very day. Matsyadeva, whose form is pure goodness, is the ruler and maintainer of the whole universe, and as such He is the director of all the demigods, headed by King <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a>. In <a href="/d/hiranmaya" class="d">Hira&#7751;maya</a>-<a href="/d/varsa" class="d">var&#7779;a</a> Lord <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a> has assumed the form of a tortoise (<a href="/d/kurma" class="d">K&#363;rma</a> <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/murti" class="d">m&#363;rti</a></span>) and is worshiped there by <a href="/d/aryama" class="d">Aryam&#257;</a>, along with all the other residents. Similarly, in the tract of land known as Uttarakuru-<a href="/d/varsa" class="d">var&#7779;a</a>, Lord &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/hari" class="d">Hari</a> has assumed the form of a boar, and in that form He accepts service from all the inhabitants living there.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">All the information in this chapter can be fully realized by one who associates with devotees of the Lord. Therefore in the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> it is recommended that one associate with devotees. This is better than residing on the banks of the Ganges. In the hearts of pure devotees reside all good sentiments as well as all the superior qualities of the demigods. In the hearts of nondevotees, however, there cannot be any good qualities, for such people are simply enchanted by the external, illusory energy of the Lord. Following in the footsteps of devotees, one should know that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the only worshipable Deity. Everyone should accept this proposal and worship the Lord. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/15/15?d=1">15.15</a>), <span class="Italic">vedai&#347; <a href="/d/ca" class="d">ca</a> sarvair <a href="/d/aham" class="d">aham</a> <a href="/d/eva" class="d">eva</a> <a href="/d/vedyah" class="d">vedya&#7717;</a>:</span> the purpose of studying all Vedic literature is to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. If after studying all the Vedic literature, one does not awaken his dormant love for the Supreme Lord, it is to be understood that he has labored for nothing. He has simply wasted his time. Lacking attachment for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he remains attached to family life in this material world. Thus the lesson of this chapter is that one should get out of family life and completely take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord.</div>
