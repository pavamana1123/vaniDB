<div class="Translation">My dear King, the merchant on the forest path of the material world, his intelligence victimized by home, wealth, relatives and so forth, runs from one place to another in search of success. Sometimes his eyes are covered by the dust of a whirlwind&mdash;that is to say, in his lust he is captivated by the beauty of his wife, especially during her menstrual period. Thus his eyes are blinded, and he cannot see where to go or what he is doing.</div>

<div class="First">It is said that household attraction resides in the wife because sex is the center of household life: <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yan" class="d">yan</a> maithun&#257;di-<a href="/d/grhamedhi" class="d">g&#7771;hamedhi</a>-<a href="/d/sukham" class="d">sukha&#7745;</a> <a href="/d/hi" class="d">hi</a> <a href="/d/tuccham" class="d">tuccham</a></I> [SB </span></I><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/7/9/45?d=1">7.9.45</a>]<span class="Italic">.</span> A materialistic person, making his wife the center of attraction, works very hard day and night. His only enjoyment in material life is sexual intercourse. Therefore <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s</span> are attracted to women as friends or wives. Indeed, they cannot work without sex. Under the circumstances the wife is compared to a whirlwind, especially during her menstrual period. Those who strictly follow the rules and regulations of householder life engage in sex only once a month, at the end of the menstrual period. As one looks forward to this opportunity, his eyes are overwhelmed by the beauty of his wife. Thus it is said that the whirlwind covers the eyes with dust. Such a lusty person does not know that all his material activities are being observed by different demigods, especially the sun-god, and are being recorded for the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/karma" class="d">karma</a></span> of one&rsquo;s next body. Astrological calculations are called <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/jyoti" class="d">jyoti</a>-<a href="/d/sastra" class="d">&#347;&#257;stra</a>.</span> Because the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/jyoti" class="d">jyoti</a>,</span> or effulgence, in the material world comes from the different stars and planets, the science is called <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/jyoti" class="d">jyoti</a>-<a href="/d/sastra" class="d">&#347;&#257;stra</a>,</span> the science of the luminaries. By the calculations of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/jyoti" class="d">jyoti</a>,</span> our future is indicated. In other words, all the luminaries&mdash;the stars, sun and moon&mdash;witness the activities of the conditioned soul. Thus he is awarded a particular type of body. A lusty, person whose eyes are covered by the dust of the whirlwind or material existence does not at all consider that his activities are being observed by different stars and planets and are being recorded. Not knowing this, the conditioned soul commits all kinds of sinful activities for the satisfaction of his lusty desires.</div>
