<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">In this chapter, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; describes <a href="/d/ananta" class="d">Ananta</a>, the source of Lord &#346;iva. Lord <a href="/d/ananta" class="d">Ananta</a>, whose body is completely spiritual, resides at the root of the planet <a href="/d/patala" class="d">P&#257;t&#257;la</a>. He always lives in the <a href="/d/core" class="d">core</a> of Lord &#346;iva&rsquo;s heart, and He helps him destroy the universe. <a href="/d/ananta" class="d">Ananta</a> instructs Lord &#346;iva how to destroy the cosmos, and thus He is sometimes called <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/tamasi" class="d">t&#257;mas&#299;</a>,</span> or &ldquo;one who is in the mode of darkness.&rdquo; He is the original Deity of material consciousness, and because He attracts all living entities, He is sometimes known as <a href="/d/sankarsana" class="d">Sa&#7749;kar&#7779;a&#7751;a</a>. The entire material world is situated on the hoods of Lord <a href="/d/sankarsana" class="d">Sa&#7749;kar&#7779;a&#7751;a</a>. From His forehead He transmits to Lord &#346;iva the power to destroy this material world. Because Lord <a href="/d/sankarsana" class="d">Sa&#7749;kar&#7779;a&#7751;a</a> is an expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, many devotees offer Him prayers, and in the planetary system of <a href="/d/patala" class="d">P&#257;t&#257;la</a>, all the <span class="Italic">suras, asuras,</span> Gandharvas, Vidy&#257;dharas and learned sages offer Him their respectful obeisances. The Lord talks with them in a sweet voice. His bodily construction is completely spiritual and very, very beautiful. Anyone who hears about Him from a proper spiritual master becomes free from all material conceptions of life. The entire material energy is working according to the plans of Anantadeva. Therefore we should regard Him as the root cause of the material creation. There is no end to His strength, and no one can fully describe Him, even with countless mouths. Therefore He is called <a href="/d/ananta" class="d">Ananta</a> (unlimited). Being very merciful toward all living entities, He has exhibited His spiritual body. &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; describes the glories of Anantadeva to <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/pariksit" class="d">Par&#299;k&#7779;it</a> in this way.</div>
