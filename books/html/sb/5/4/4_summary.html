<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">In this chapter, &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva, the son of <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/nabhi" class="d">N&#257;bhi</a>, begot a hundred sons, and during the reign of those sons the world was very happy in all respects. When &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva appeared as the son of <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/nabhi" class="d">N&#257;bhi</a>, He was appreciated by the people as the most exalted and beautiful personality of that age. His poise, influence, strength, enthusiasm, bodily luster and other transcendental qualities were beyond compare. The word <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/rsabha" class="d">&#7771;&#7779;abha</a></span> refers to the best, or the supreme. Due to the superexcellent attributes of the son of <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/nabhi" class="d">N&#257;bhi</a>, the King named his son &#7770;&#7779;abha, or &ldquo;the best.&rdquo; His influence was incomparable. Although there was a scarcity of rain, &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva did not care for <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a>, the King of heaven, who is in charge of supplying rain. Through His own potency, &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva sumptuously covered Ajan&#257;bha with ample rain. Upon receiving &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva, who is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as his son, King <a href="/d/nabhi" class="d">N&#257;bhi</a> began to raise Him very carefully. After that, he entrusted the ruling power to Him and, retiring from family life, lived at Badarik&#257;&#347;rama completely engaged in the worship of <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">V&#257;sudeva</a>, the Supreme Lord. To follow social customs, Lord &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva for a while became a student in the <span class="Italic">gurukula,</span> and after returning. He followed the orders of His <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/guru" class="d">guru</a></span> and accepted a wife named Jayant&#299;, who had been given to Him by the King of heaven, <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a>. He begot a hundred sons in the womb of Jayant&#299;. Of these hundred sons, the eldest was known as <a href="/d/bharata" class="d">Bharata</a>. Since the reign of <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/bharata" class="d">Bharata</a>, this planet has been called <a href="/d/bharata" class="d">Bh&#257;rata</a>-<a href="/d/varsa" class="d">var&#7779;a</a>. &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva&rsquo;s other sons were headed by <a href="/d/kusavarta" class="d">Ku&#347;&#257;varta</a>, Il&#257;varta, <a href="/d/brahmavarta" class="d">Brahm&#257;varta</a>, <a href="/d/malaya" class="d">Malaya</a>, <a href="/d/ketu" class="d">Ketu</a>, Bhadrasena, Indrasp&#7771;k, <a href="/d/vidarbha" class="d">Vidarbha</a> and K&#299;ka&#7789;a. There were also other sons named <a href="/d/kavi" class="d">Kavi</a>, Havi, Antarik&#7779;a, <a href="/d/prabuddha" class="d">Prabuddha</a>, Pippal&#257;yana, Avirhotra, Drumila, Camasa and Karabh&#257;jana. Instead of ruling the kingdom, these nine became mendicant preachers of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness, following the religious precepts of the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a>.</span> Their characteristics and activities are described in the Eleventh Canto of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a></span> during the talks between <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">Vasudeva</a> and <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> at <a href="/d/kuruksetra" class="d">Kuruk&#7779;etra</a>. To teach the general populace, King &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva performed many sacrifices and taught His sons how to rule the citizens.</div>
