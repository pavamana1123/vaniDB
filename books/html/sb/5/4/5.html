<div class="Translation">King <a href="/d/nabhi" class="d">N&#257;bhi</a> understood that his son, &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva, was very popular among the citizens and among government officers and ministers. Understanding the popularity of his son, <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/nabhi" class="d">N&#257;bhi</a> enthroned Him as the emperor of the world to give protection to the general populace in terms of the Vedic religious system. To do this, he entrusted Him into the hands of learned br&#257;hma&#7751;as, who would guide Him in administrating the government. Then <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/nabhi" class="d">N&#257;bhi</a> and his wife, Merudev&#299;, went to Badarik&#257;&#347;rama in the <a href="/d/himalaya" class="d">Himalaya</a> Mountains, where the King engaged Himself very expertly in austerities and penances with great jubilation. In full <a href="/d/samadhi" class="d">sam&#257;dhi</a> he worshiped the Supreme Personality of Godhead, <a href="/d/nara" class="d">Nara</a>-<a href="/d/narayana" class="d">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</a>, who is <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> in His plenary expansion.

In addition, he wanted to entrust his son into the hands of the learned <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as.</span> This means that a monarch was supposed to govern strictly according to Vedic principles under the guidance of learned <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> who could advise Him according to the standard Vedic scriptures like <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/manu" class="d">Manu</a>-<a href="/d/smrti" class="d">sm&#7771;ti</a></span> and similar <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras.</span> It is the duty of the king to rule the citizens according to Vedic principles.

A <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> must perform the duty of a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> without cheating the public. It is not that one attains the name of a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> without the qualifications. It is the king&rsquo;s duty to see that everyone engages in his occupational duty according to Vedic principles. In addition, retirement at the end of life is compulsory. <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/nabhi" class="d">N&#257;bhi</a>, although still a king. retired from family life and went with his wife to a place called Badarik&#257;&#347;rama in the Himalayas, where the Deity <a href="/d/nara" class="d">Nara</a>-<a href="/d/narayana" class="d">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</a> is worshiped. The words <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/prasanna" class="d">prasanna</a>-<a href="/d/nipunena" class="d">nipu&#7751;ena</a> <a href="/d/tapasa" class="d">tapas&#257;</a></span> indicate that the King accepted all kinds of austerity very expertly and jubilantly. He did not at all mind leaving his comfortable life at home, although he was the emperor. Despite undergoing severe austerities and penances, he felt very pleased at Badarik&#257;&#347;rama, and he did everything there expertly. In this way, being fully absorbed in <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness (<span class="Italic"><a href="/d/samadhi" class="d">sam&#257;dhi</a>-<a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span>). always thinking of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">V&#257;sudeva</a>, <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/nabhi" class="d">N&#257;bhi</a> attained success at the end of his life and was promoted to the spiritual world, Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;haloka.</div>
<A NAME="67782"></A><div id="67782"> </div>
<div class="Purport">This is the way of Vedic life. One must stop the process of repeated birth and death and return home, back to Godhead. The words <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/tan" class="d">tan</a>-<a href="/d/mahimanam" class="d">mahim&#257;nam</a> <a href="/d/avapa" class="d">av&#257;pa</a></span> are significant in this regard. &#346;r&#299;la &#346;r&#299;dhara <a href="/d/svami" class="d">Sv&#257;m&#299;</a> says that <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/mahima" class="d">mahim&#257;</a></span> means liberation in this life. We should act in such a way in this life that after giving up this body, we will become liberated from the bondage of repeated birth and death. This is called <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/jivan" class="d">j&#299;van</a>-<a href="/d/mukti" class="d">mukti</a>.</span> &#346;r&#299;la V&#299;rar&#257;ghava &#256;c&#257;rya states that in the <span class="Italic">Ch&#257;ndogya <a href="/d/upanisad" class="d">Upani&#7779;ad</a></span> there are eight symptoms of a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/jivan" class="d">j&#299;van</a>-<a href="/d/mukta" class="d">mukta</a>,</span> a person who is already liberated even when living in this body. The first symptom of one so liberated is that he is freed from all sinful activity (<span class="Italic"><a href="/d/apahata" class="d">apahata</a>-<a href="/d/papa" class="d">p&#257;pa</a></span>). As long as one is under the clutches of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/maya" class="d">m&#257;y&#257;</a></span> in the material energy, one has to engage in sinful activity. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> describes such people as <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/duskrtinah" class="d">du&#7779;k&#7771;tina&#7717;</a>,</span> which indicates that they are always engaged in sinful activity. One who is liberated in this life does not commit any sinful activities. Sinful activity involves illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling. Another symptom of a liberated person is <span class="Italic">vijara,</span> which indicates that he is not subjected to the miseries of old age. Another symptom is <span class="Italic">vim&#7771;tyu.</span> A liberated person prepares himself in such a way that he does not take on any more material bodies, which are destined to die. In other words. he does not fall down again to repeat birth and death. Another symptom is <span class="Italic">vi&#347;oka,</span> which indicates that he is callous to material distress and happiness. Another is <span class="Italic">vijighatsa,</span> which indicates that he no longer desires material enjoyment. Another symptom is <span class="Italic">apip&#257;t&#257;,</span> which means that he has no desire other than to engage in the devotional service of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, his dearmost pursuable Lord. A further symptom is <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/satya" class="d">satya</a>-<a href="/d/kama" class="d">k&#257;ma</a>,</span> which indicates that all his desires are directed to the Supreme Truth, <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. He does not want anything else. He is <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/satya" class="d">satya</a>-<a href="/d/sankalpa" class="d">sa&#7749;kalpa</a>.</span> Whatever he desires is fulfilled by the grace of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. First of all, he does not desire anything for his material benefit, and secondly if he desires anything at all, he simply desires to serve the Supreme Lord. That desire is fulfilled by the Lord&rsquo;s grace. That is called <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/satya" class="d">satya</a>-<a href="/d/sankalpa" class="d">sa&#7749;kalpa</a>.</span> &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha <a href="/d/cakravarti" class="d">Cakravart&#299;</a> points out that the word <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/mahima" class="d">mahim&#257;</a></span> means returning to the spiritual world, back home, back to <a href="/d/vaikuntha" class="d">Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha</a>. &#346;r&#299; &#346;ukadeva says that the word <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/mahima" class="d">mahim&#257;</a></span> means that the devotee attains the qualities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is called <span class="Italic">sadharma,</span> or &ldquo;the same quality.&rdquo; Just as <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is never born and never dies, His devotees who return to Godhead never die and never take birth within the material world.</div>
