<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">In this chapter, the activities of King <a href="/d/bharata" class="d">Bharata</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a>, the emperor of the whole world, are described. <a href="/d/bharata" class="d">Bharata</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> performed various ritualistic ceremonies (Vedic <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;as</span>) and satisfied the Supreme Lord by his different modes of worship. In due course of time, he left home and resided in Hardwar and passed his days in devotional activities. Being ordered by his father, Lord &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva, <a href="/d/bharata" class="d">Bharata</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> married Pa&ntilde;cajan&#299;, the daughter of <a href="/d/visvarupa" class="d">Vi&#347;var&#363;pa</a>. After this, he ruled the whole world peacefully. Formerly this planet was known as Ajan&#257;bha, and after the reign of <a href="/d/bharata" class="d">Bharata</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> it became known as <a href="/d/bharata" class="d">Bh&#257;rata</a>-<a href="/d/varsa" class="d">var&#7779;a</a>. <a href="/d/bharata" class="d">Bharata</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> begot five sons in the womb of Pa&ntilde;cajan&#299;, and he named the sons Sumati, R&#257;&#7779;&#7789;rabh&#7771;ta, <a href="/d/sudarsana" class="d">Sudar&#347;ana</a>, &#256;vara&#7751;a and Dh&#363;mraketu. <a href="/d/bharata" class="d">Bharata</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> was very rigid in executing religious principles and following in the footsteps of his father. He therefore ruled the citizens very successfully. Because he performed various <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;as</span> to satisfy the Supreme Lord, he was personally very satisfied. Being of undisturbed mind, he increased his devotional activities unto Lord <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">V&#257;sudeva</a>. <a href="/d/bharata" class="d">Bharata</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> was competent in understanding the principles of saintly persons like <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a>, and he followed in the footsteps of the sages. He also kept Lord <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">V&#257;sudeva</a> constantly within his heart. After finishing his kingly duties, he divided his kingdom among his five sons. He then left home and went to the place of <a href="/d/pulaha" class="d">Pulaha</a> known as Pulah&#257;&#347;rama. There he ate forest vegetables and fruits, and worshiped Lord <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">V&#257;sudeva</a> with everything available. Thus he increased his devotion toward <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">V&#257;sudeva</a>, and he automatically began to realize further his transcendental, blissful life. Due to his highly advanced spiritual position, there were sometimes visible in his body the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/asta" class="d">a&#7779;&#7789;a</a>-<a href="/d/sattvika" class="d">s&#257;ttvika</a></span> transformations, such as ecstatic crying and bodily trembling, which are symptoms of love of Godhead. It is understood that <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/bharata" class="d">Bharata</a> worshiped the Supreme Lord with the <span class="Italic">mantras</span> mentioned in the <span class="Italic">&#7770;g <a href="/d/veda" class="d">Veda</a>,</span> generally known as <a href="/d/gayatri" class="d">G&#257;yatr&#299;</a> <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/mantra" class="d">mantra</a>,</span> which aim at the Supreme <a href="/d/narayana" class="d">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</a> situated within the sun.</div>
