<div class="Translation">All the women addressed the King: O master of the citizens, we do not know why your dear wife has taken on this sort of existence. O killer of enemies, kindly look! She is lying on the ground without bedding. We cannot understand why she is acting this way.</div>

<div class="First">When a person is devoid of devotional service, or <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/visnu" class="d">vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a>-<a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">bhakti</a>,</span> he takes to many sinful activities. King <a href="/d/puranjana" class="d">Pura&ntilde;jana</a> left home, neglected his own wife and engaged himself in killing animals. This is the position of all materialistic men. They do not care for a married chaste wife. They take the wife only as an instrument for sense enjoyment, not as a means for devotional service. To have unrestricted sex life, the <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s</span> work very hard. They have concluded that the best course is to have sex with any woman and simply pay the price for her, as though she were a mercantile commodity. Thus they engage their energy in working very hard for such material acquisitions. Such materialistic people have lost their good intelligence. They must search out their intelligence within the heart. A person who does not have a chaste wife accepted by religious principles always has a bewildered intelligence.</div>
<A NAME="62502"></A><div id="62502"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The wife of King <a href="/d/puranjana" class="d">Pura&ntilde;jana</a> was lying on the ground because she was neglected by her husband. Actually the woman must always be protected by her husband. We always speak of the goddess of fortune as being placed on the chest of <a href="/d/narayana" class="d">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</a>. In other words, the wife must remain embraced by her husband. Thus she becomes beloved and well protected. Just as one saves his money and places it under his own personal protection, one should similarly protect his wife by his own personal supervision. Just as intelligence is always within the heart, so a beloved chaste wife should always have her place on the chest of a good husband. This is the proper relationship between husband and wife. A wife is therefore called <span class="Italic">ardh&#257;&#7749;gan&#299;,</span> or half of the body. One cannot remain with only one leg, one hand or only one side of the body. He must have two sides. Similarly, according to nature&rsquo;s way, husband and wife should live together. In the lower species of life, among birds and animals, it is seen that by nature&rsquo;s arrangement the husband and wife live together. It is similarly ideal in human life for the husband and wife to live together. The home should be a place for devotional service, and the wife should be chaste and accepted by a ritualistic ceremony. In this way one can become happy at home.</div>
