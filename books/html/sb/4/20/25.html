<div class="Translation">My dear Lord, You are glorified by the selected verses uttered by great personalities. Such glorification of Your lotus feet is just like saffron particles. When the transcendental vibration from the mouths of great devotees carries the aroma of the saffron dust of Your lotus feet, the forgetful living entity gradually remembers his eternal relationship with You. Devotees thus gradually come to the right conclusion about the value of life. My dear Lord, I therefore do not need any other benediction but the opportunity to hear from the mouth of Your pure devotee.</div>
<A NAME="57807"></A><div id="57807"> </div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<A NAME="57808"></A><div id="57808"> </div>
<div class="First">It is explained in the previous verse that one has to hear glorification of the Lord from the mouth of a pure devotee. This is further explained here. The transcendental vibration from the mouth of a pure devotee is so powerful that it can revive the living entity&rsquo;s memory of his eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In our material existence, under the influence of illusory <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/maya" class="d">m&#257;y&#257;</a>,</span> we have almost forgotten our eternal relationship with the Lord, exactly like a man sleeping very deeply who forgets his duties. In the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> it is said that every one of us is sleeping under the influence of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/maya" class="d">m&#257;y&#257;</a>.</span> We must get up from this slumber and engage in the right service, for thus we can properly utilize the facility of this human form of life. As expressed in a song by &#7788;h&#257;kura Bhaktivinoda, Lord <a href="/d/caitanya" class="d">Caitanya</a> says, <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/jiva" class="d">j&#299;va</a> <a href="/d/jaga" class="d">j&#257;ga</a>, <a href="/d/jiva" class="d">j&#299;va</a> <a href="/d/jaga" class="d">j&#257;ga</a>.</span> The Lord asks every sleeping living entity to get up and engage in devotional service so that his mission in this human form of life may be fulfilled. This awakening voice comes through the mouth of a pure devotee.</div>
<A NAME="57809"></A><div id="57809"> </div>
<div class="Purport">A pure devotee always engages in the service of the Lord, taking shelter of His lotus feet, and therefore he has a direct connection with the saffron mercy-particles that are strewn over the lotus feet of the Lord. Although when a pure devotee speaks the articulation of his voice may resemble the sound of this material sky, the voice is spiritually very powerful because it touches the particles of saffron dust on the lotus feet of the Lord. As soon as a sleeping living entity hears the powerful voice emanating from the mouth of a pure devotee, he immediately remembers his eternal relationship with the Lord, although up until that moment he had forgotten everything.</div>
<A NAME="57810"></A><div id="57810"> </div>
<div class="Purport">For a conditioned soul, therefore, it is very important to hear from the mouth of a pure devotee, who is fully surrendered to the lotus feet of the Lord without any material desire, speculative knowledge or contamination of the modes of material nature. Every one of us is <span class="Italic">kuyog&#299;</span> because we have engaged in the service of this material world, forgetting our eternal relationship with the Lord as His eternal loving servants. It is our duty to rise from the <span class="Italic">kuyoga</span> platform to become <span class="Italic">suyog&#299;s,</span> perfect mystics. The process of hearing from a pure devotee is recommended in all Vedic scriptures, especially by Lord <a href="/d/caitanya" class="d">Caitanya</a> <a href="/d/mahaprabhu" class="d">Mah&#257;prabhu</a>. One may stay in his position of life&mdash;it does not matter what it is&mdash;but if one hears from the mouth of a pure devotee, he gradually comes to the understanding of his relationship with the Lord and thus engages in His loving service, and his life becomes completely perfect. Therefore, this process of hearing from the mouth of a pure devotee is very important for making progress in the line of spiritual understanding.</div>
