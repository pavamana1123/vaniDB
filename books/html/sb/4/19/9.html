<div class="Translation">King <a href="/d/prthu" class="d">P&#7771;thu</a> was presented with various gifts from the general populace and predominating deities of all planets. The oceans and seas were full of valuable jewels and pearls, and the hills were full of chemicals and fertilizers. Four kinds of edibles were produced profusely.</div>

<div class="First">As stated in <span class="Italic">&#298;&#347;opani&#7779;ad,</span> this material creation is supplied with all the potencies for the production of all necessities required by the living entities&mdash;not only human beings, but animals, reptiles, aquatics and trees. The oceans and seas produce pearls, coral and valuable jewels so that fortunate law-abiding people can utilize them. Similarly, the hills are full of chemicals so that when rivers flow down from them the chemicals spread over the fields to fertilize the four kinds of foodstuffs. These are technically known as <span class="Italic">carvya</span> (those edibles which are chewed), <span class="Italic">lehya</span> (those which are licked up), <span class="Italic">c&#363;&#7779;ya</span> (those which are swallowed) and <span class="Italic">peya</span> (those which are drunk).</div>
<A NAME="57046"></A><div id="57046"> </div>
<div class="Purport"><a href="/d/prthu" class="d">P&#7771;thu</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> was greeted by the residents of other planets and their presiding deities. They presented various gifts to the King and acknowledged him as the proper type of king by whose planning and activities everyone throughout the universe could be happy and prosperous. It is clearly indicated in this verse that the oceans and seas are meant for producing jewels, but in <a href="/d/kali" class="d">Kali</a>-<a href="/d/yuga" class="d">yuga</a> the oceans are mainly being utilized for fishing. <span class="Italic">&#346;&#363;dras</span> and poor men were allowed to fish, but the higher classes like the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas</span> and <span class="Italic">vai&#347;yas</span> would gather pearls, jewels and coral. Although poor men would catch tons of fish, they would not be equal in value to one piece of coral or pearl. In this age so many factories for the manufacture of fertilizers have been opened, but when the Personality of Godhead is pleased by the performance of <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;as,</span> the hills automatically produce fertilizing chemicals, which help produce edibles in the fields. Everything is dependent on the people&rsquo;s acceptance of the Vedic principles of sacrifice.</div>
