<div class="Translation"><a href="/d/puranjana" class="d">Pura&ntilde;jana</a>, the hero, became attracted by the eyebrows and smiling face of the very beautiful girl and was immediately pierced by the arrows of her lusty desires. When she smiled shyly, she looked very beautiful to <a href="/d/puranjana" class="d">Pura&ntilde;jana</a>, who, although a hero, could not refrain from addressing her.</div>

<div class="First">Every living entity is a hero in two ways. When he is a victim of the illusory energy, he works as a great hero in the material world, as a great leader, politician, businessman, industrialist, etc., and his heroic activities contribute to the material advancement of civilization. One can also become a hero by being master of the senses, a <span class="Italic">gosv&#257;m&#299;.</span> Material activities are false heroic activities, whereas restraining the senses from material engagement is great heroism. However great a hero one may be in the material world, he can be immediately conquered by the lumps of flesh and blood known as the breasts of women. In the history of material activities there are many examples, like the Roman hero Antony, who became captivated by the beauty of Cleopatra. Similarly, a great hero in India named <a href="/d/baji" class="d">Baji</a> Rao became a victim of a woman during the time of Maharashtrian politics, and he was defeated. From history we understand that formerly politicians used to employ beautiful girls who were trained as <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/visa" class="d">vi&#7779;a</a>-<a href="/d/kanya" class="d">kany&#257;</a>.</span> These girls had poison injected into their bodies from the beginning of their lives so that in due course of time they would become so immune to the poison and so poisonous themselves that simply by kissing a person they could kill him. These poisonous girls were engaged to see an enemy and kill him with a kiss. Thus there are many instances in human history of heroes who have been curbed simply by women. Being part and parcel of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, the living entity is certainly a great hero, but due to his own weakness he becomes attracted to the material features.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">It is said in the <I>P<span class="Italic"></I>rema-<a href="/d/vivarta" class="d">vivarta</a></span> that when a living entity wants to enjoy material nature, he is immediately victimized by the material energy. A living entity is not forced to come into the material world. He makes his own choice, being attracted by beautiful women. Every living entity has the freedom to be attracted by material nature or to stand as a hero and resist that attraction. It is simply a question of the living entity&rsquo;s being attracted or not being attracted. There is no question of his being forced to come into contact with material energy. One who can keep himself steady and resist the attraction of material nature is certainly a hero and deserves to be called a <span class="Italic">gosv&#257;m&#299;.</span> Unless one is master of the senses, he cannot become a <span class="Italic">gosv&#257;m&#299;.</span> The living entity can take one of two positions in this world. He may become a servant of his senses, or he may become master of them. By becoming a servant of the senses, one becomes a great material hero, and by becoming master of the senses, he becomes a <span class="Italic">gosv&#257;m&#299;,</span> or spiritual hero.</div>
