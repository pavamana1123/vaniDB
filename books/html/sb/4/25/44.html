<div class="Translation">Many professional singers used to sing about the glories of King <a href="/d/puranjana" class="d">Pura&ntilde;jana</a> and his glorious activities. When it was too hot in the summer, he used to enter a reservoir of water. He would surround himself with many women and enjoy their company.</div>

<div class="First">A living being has different activities in different stages of life. One stage is called <span class="Italic">j&#257;grata,</span> or the life of awakening, and another is called <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/svapna" class="d">svapna</a>,</span> or the life of dream. Another stage is called <span class="Italic">susupti,</span> or life in an unconscious state, and still another stage occurs after death. In the previous verse the life of awakening was described; that is, the man and the woman were married and enjoyed life for one hundred years. In this verse life in the dream state is described, for the activities <a href="/d/puranjana" class="d">Pura&ntilde;jana</a> accomplished during the day were also reflected at night in the dream state. <a href="/d/puranjana" class="d">Pura&ntilde;jana</a> used to live with his wife for sense enjoyment, and at night this very sense enjoyment was appreciated in different ways. A man sleeps very soundly when he is greatly fatigued, and when a rich man is greatly fatigued he goes to his garden house with many female friends and there enters the water and enjoys their company. Such is the tendency of the living entity within this material world. A living entity is never satisfied with a woman unless he is trained in the system of <span class="Italic">brahmacarya.</span> Generally a man&rsquo;s tendency is to enjoy many women, and even at the very end of life the sex impulse is so strong that even though one is very old he still wants to enjoy the company of young girls. Thus because of the strong sex impulse the living entity becomes more and more involved in this material world.</div>
