<div class="Translation">The planet earth spoke: My dear Lord, O Supreme Personality of Godhead, You are transcendental in Your position, and by Your material energy You have expanded Yourself in various forms and species of life through the interaction of the three modes of material nature. Unlike some other masters, You always remain in Your transcendental position and are not affected by the material creation, which is subject to different material interactions. Consequently You are not bewildered by material activities.</div>

<div class="First">After King <a href="/d/prthu" class="d">P&#7771;thu</a> gave his royal command, the planet earth in the shape of a cow could understand that the King was a directly empowered incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Consequently the King knew everything&mdash;past, present and future. Thus there was no possibility of the earth&rsquo;s cheating him. The earth was accused of hiding the seeds of all herbs and grains, and therefore she is preparing to explain how the seeds of these herbs and grains can be again exposed. The earth knew that the King was very angry with her, and she realized that unless she pacified his anger, there was no possibility of placing a positive program before him. Therefore in the beginning of her speech she very humbly presents herself as a part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead&rsquo;s body. She submits that the various bodily forms manifest in the physical world are but different parts and parcels of the supreme gigantic body. It is said that the lower planetary systems are parts and parcels of the legs of the Lord, whereas the upper planetary systems are parts and parcels of the Lord&rsquo;s head. The Lord creates this material world by His external energy, but this external energy is in one sense not different from Him. Yet at the same time the Lord is not directly manifest in the external energy but is always situated in the spiritual energy. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/9/10?d=1">9.10</a>), <span class="Italic">may&#257;dhyak&#7779;e&#7751;a <a href="/d/prakrtih" class="d">prak&#7771;ti&#7717;</a>:</span> material nature is working under the direction of the Lord. Therefore the Lord is not unattached to the external energy, and He is addressed in this verse as <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/guna" class="d">gu&#7751;a</a>-<a href="/d/atma" class="d">&#257;tm&#257;</a>,</span> the source of the three modes of material nature. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/13/15?d=1">13.15</a>), <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/nirgunam" class="d">nirgu&#7751;a&#7745;</a> <a href="/d/guna" class="d">gu&#7751;a</a>-<a href="/d/bhoktr" class="d">bhokt&#7771;</a> <a href="/d/ca" class="d">ca</a>:</span> although the Lord is not attached to the external energy, He is nonetheless the master of it. The philosophy of Lord <a href="/d/caitanya" class="d">Caitanya</a>, upholding that the Lord is simultaneously one with and different from His creation (<span class="Italic">), is very easily understandable in this connection. The planet earth explains that although the Lord is attached to the external energy, He is <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/nirdhuta" class="d">nirdhuta</a>;</span> He is completely free from the activities of the external energy. The Lord is always situated in His internal energy. Therefore in this verse it is stated: <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/svarupa" class="d">svar&#363;pa</a>-<a href="/d/anubhavena" class="d">anubhavena</a>.</span> The Lord remains completely in His internal potency and yet has full knowledge of the external energy as well as the internal energy, just as His devotee remains always in a transcendental position, keeping himself in the service of the Lord without becoming attached to the material body. &#346;r&#299;la <a href="/d/rupa" class="d">R&#363;pa</a> Gosv&#257;m&#299; says that the devotee who is always engaged in the devotional service of the Lord is always liberated, regardless of his material situation. If it is possible for a devotee to remain transcendental, it is certainly possible for the Supreme Personality of Godhead to remain in His internal potency without being attached to the external potency. There should be no difficulty in understanding this situation. Just as a devotee is never bewildered by his material body, the Lord is never bewildered by the external energy of this material world. A devotee is not hampered by the material body, although he is situated in a physical body that runs according to so many material conditions, just as there are five kinds of air functioning within the body, and so many organs&mdash;the hands, legs, tongue, genitals, rectum, etc.&mdash;all working differently. The spirit soul, the living entity, who is in full knowledge of his position is always engaged in chanting <a href="/d/hare" class="d">Hare</a> <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, <a href="/d/hare" class="d">Hare</a> <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, <a href="/d/hare" class="d">Hare</a> Hare/ <a href="/d/hare" class="d">Hare</a> <a href="/d/rama" class="d">R&#257;ma</a>, <a href="/d/hare" class="d">Hare</a> <a href="/d/rama" class="d">R&#257;ma</a>, <a href="/d/rama" class="d">R&#257;ma</a> R&#257;ma, <a href="/d/hare" class="d">Hare</a> Hare and is not concerned with the bodily functions. Although the Lord is connected with the material world, He is always situated in His spiritual energy and is always unattached to the functions of the material world. As far as the material body is concerned, there are six &ldquo;waves,&rdquo; or symptomatic material conditions: hunger, thirst, lamentation, bewilderment, old age and death. The liberated soul is never concerned with these six physical interactions. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, being the all-powerful master of all energies, has some connection with the external energy, but He is always free from the interactions of the external energy in the material world.</div>
