<div class="Translation">The Vedas give the eternal regulative principles for auspicious advancement in human civilization which have been rigidly followed in the past. The strong evidence of this principle is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is called <a href="/d/janardana" class="d">Jan&#257;rdana</a>, the well-wisher of all living entities.</div>
<A NAME="48229"></A><div id="48229"> </div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<A NAME="48230"></A><div id="48230"> </div>
<div class="First">In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> the Supreme Personality of Godhead, <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, has claimed that He is the father of all living entities, regardless of form. There are 8,400,000 different species of life forms, and Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> claims that He is the father of all. Because the living entities are parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they are all sons of the Lord, and for their benefit, because they are hovering under the impression that they can lord it over material nature, the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> are given to them for their guidance. Therefore the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> are called <span class="Italic">apauru&#7779;eya,</span> for they are not written by any man or demigod, including the first living creature, <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a>. <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> is not the creator or author of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> He is also one of the living beings in this material world; therefore he does not have the power to write or speak the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> independently. Every living entity within this material world is subject to four deficiencies: he commits mistakes, he accepts one thing for another, he cheats, and he has imperfect senses. The <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> however, are not written by any living creature within this material world. Therefore they are said to be <span class="Italic">apauru&#7779;eya.</span> No one can trace out the history of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> Of course, modern human civilization has no chronological history of the world or the universe, and it cannot present actual historical facts older than three thousand years. But no one has traced out when the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> were written, because they were never written by any living being within this material world. All other systems of knowledge are defective because they have been written or spoken by men or demigods who are products of this material creation, but <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> is <span class="Italic">apauru&#7779;eya,</span> for it was not spoken by any human being or any demigod of this material creation; it was spoken by Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, who is beyond the material creation. That is accepted by such stalwart scholars as &#346;a&#7749;kar&#257;c&#257;rya, not to speak of other <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas</span> such as R&#257;m&#257;nuj&#257;c&#257;rya and Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya. &#346;a&#7749;kar&#257;c&#257;rya has accepted that <a href="/d/narayana" class="d">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</a> and <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> are transcendental, and in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> also Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> has established, <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/aham" class="d">aha&#7745;</a> <a href="/d/sarvasya" class="d">sarvasya</a> prabhavo <a href="/d/mattah" class="d">matta&#7717;</a> <a href="/d/sarvam" class="d">sarva&#7745;</a> <a href="/d/pravartate" class="d">pravartate</a>:</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/10/8?d=1">10.8</a>] &ldquo;I am the origin of everything; everything emanates from Me.&rdquo; This material creation, including <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> and &#346;iva and all the demigods, has been created by Him, for everything has emanated from Him. He also says that the purpose of all the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> is to understand Him (<span class="Italic">vedai&#347; <a href="/d/ca" class="d">ca</a> sarvair <a href="/d/aham" class="d">aham</a> <a href="/d/eva" class="d">eva</a> <a href="/d/vedyah" class="d">vedya&#7717;</a></I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/15/15?d=1">15.15</a>]). He is the original <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/veda" class="d">veda</a>-<a href="/d/vit" class="d">vit</a>,</span> or knower of the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> and <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/vedanta" class="d">ved&#257;nta</a>-<a href="/d/krt" class="d">k&#7771;t</a>,</span> or compiler of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/vedanta" class="d">Ved&#257;nta</a>.</span> <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> is not the compiler of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span></div>
<A NAME="48231"></A><div id="48231"> </div>
<div class="Purport">In the beginning of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a></span> it is established, <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/tene" class="d">tene</a> <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">brahma</a> <a href="/d/hrda" class="d">h&#7771;d&#257;</a>:</span> the Supreme Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, instructed <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> in the Vedic knowledge through his heart. Therefore the evidence that Vedic knowledge is free from the defects of mistakes, illusions, cheating and imperfection is that it is spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, <a href="/d/janardana" class="d">Jan&#257;rdana</a>, and has thus been followed from time immemorial, beginning from <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a>. The Vedic religion or the principles of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> have been followed by the highly cultured population of India since time immemorial; no one can trace out the history of Vedic religion. Therefore it is <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sanatana" class="d">san&#257;tana</a>,</span> and any blasphemy against the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> is calculated to be atheism. The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> are described as <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/setu" class="d">setu</a>,</span> which means &ldquo;a bridge.&rdquo; If one wants to attain his spiritual existence, one has to cross an ocean of nescience. The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> are the bridge by which to cross such a great ocean.</div>
<A NAME="48232"></A><div id="48232"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> describe how to divide the human race into four divisions according to quality and working capacity. This is a very scientific system, and it is also <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sanatana" class="d">san&#257;tana</a>,</span> for no one can trace out its history and it has no dissolution. No one can stop the system of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/varna" class="d">var&#7751;a</a></span> and <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/asrama" class="d">&#257;&#347;rama</a>,</span> or the castes and divisions. For example, whether or not one accepts the name <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a>,</span> there is a class in society which is known as the intelligent class and which is interested in spiritual understanding and philosophy. Similarly, there is a class of men who are interested in administration and in ruling others. In the Vedic system these martially spirited men are called <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas.</span> Similarly, everywhere there is a class of men who are interested in economic development, business, industry and money-making; they are called <span class="Italic">vai&#347;yas.</span> And there is another class who are neither intelligent nor martially spirited nor endowed with the capacity for economic development but who simply can serve others. They are called <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras,</span> or the laborer class. This system is <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sanatana" class="d">san&#257;tana</a></span>&mdash;it comes from time immemorial, and it will continue in the same way. There is no power in the world which can stop it. Therefore, since this <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sanatana" class="d">san&#257;tana</a>-<a href="/d/dharma" class="d">dharma</a></span> system is eternal, one can elevate himself to the highest standard of spiritual life by following the Vedic principles.</div>
<A NAME="48233"></A><div id="48233"> </div>
<div class="Purport">It is stated that formerly the sages followed this system; therefore to follow the Vedic system is to follow the standard etiquette of society. But the followers of Lord &#346;iva, who are drunkards, who are addicted to intoxicants and sex life, who do not bathe and who smoke <span class="Italic">g&#257;&ntilde;j&#257;,</span> are against all human etiquette. The conclusion is that persons who rebel against the Vedic principles are themselves the evidence that the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> are authoritative, because by not following the Vedic principles they become like animals. Such animalistic persons are themselves evidence of the supremacy of the Vedic regulations.</div>
