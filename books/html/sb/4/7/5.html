<div class="Translation">Those who have had their arms cut off will have to work with the arms of A&#347;vin&#299;-<a href="/d/kumara" class="d">kum&#257;ra</a>, and those whose hands were cut off will have to do their work with the hands of <a href="/d/pusa" class="d">P&#363;&#7779;&#257;</a>. The priests will also have to act in that manner. As for <a href="/d/bhrgu" class="d">Bh&#7771;gu</a>, he will have the beard from the goat&rsquo;s head.</div>

<div class="First"><a href="/d/bhrgu" class="d">Bh&#7771;gu</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a>, a great supporter of <a href="/d/daksa" class="d">Dak&#7779;a</a>, was awarded the beard of the goat&rsquo;s head which was substituted for the head of <a href="/d/daksa" class="d">Dak&#7779;a</a>. It appears from the exchange of Dak&#7779;a&rsquo;s head that the modern scientific theory that the brain substance is the cause of all intelligent work is not valid. The brain substance of <a href="/d/daksa" class="d">Dak&#7779;a</a> and that of a goat are different, but <a href="/d/daksa" class="d">Dak&#7779;a</a> still acted like himself, even though his head was replaced by that of a goat. The conclusion is that it is the particular consciousness of an individual soul which acts. The brain substance is only an instrument which has nothing to do with real intelligence. The real intelligence, mind and consciousness are part of the particular individual soul. It will be found in the verses ahead that after Dak&#7779;a&rsquo;s head was replaced by the goat&rsquo;s head, he was as intelligent as he had previously been. He prayed very nicely to satisfy Lord &#346;iva and Lord <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a>, which is not possible for a goat to do. Therefore it is definitely concluded that the brain substance is not the center of intelligence; it is the consciousness of a particular soul that works intelligently. The whole movement of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness is to purify the consciousness. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what kind of brain one has because if he simply transfers his consciousness from matter to <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, his life becomes successful. It is confirmed by the Lord Himself in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> that anyone who takes up <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness achieves the highest perfection of life, regardless of whatever abominable condition of life he may have fallen into. Specifically, anyone in <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness goes back to Godhead, back to home, on leaving his present material body.</div>
