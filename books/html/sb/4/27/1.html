<div class="Translation">The great sage <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> continued: My dear King, after bewildering her husband in different ways and bringing him under her control, the wife of King <a href="/d/puranjana" class="d">Pura&ntilde;jana</a> gave him all satisfaction and enjoyed sex life with him.</div>
<A NAME="62651"></A><div id="62651"> </div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<A NAME="62652"></A><div id="62652"> </div>
<div class="First">After hunting in the forest, King <a href="/d/puranjana" class="d">Pura&ntilde;jana</a> returned home, and after refreshing himself by taking a bath and eating nice food, he searched for his wife. When he saw her lying down on the ground without a bed, as if neglected, and devoid of any proper dress, he became very much aggrieved. He then became attracted to her and began to enjoy her company. A living entity is similarly engaged in the material world in sinful activities. These sinful activities may be compared to King Pura&ntilde;jana&rsquo;s hunting in the forest.</div>
<A NAME="62653"></A><div id="62653"> </div>
<div class="Purport">A sinful life can be counteracted by various processes of religion such as <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yajna" class="d">yaj&ntilde;a</a>, <a href="/d/vrata" class="d">vrata</a></span> and <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/dana" class="d">d&#257;na</a></span>&mdash;that is, the performance of sacrifices, the taking of a vow for some religious ritual, and the giving of charity. In this way one may become free from the reactions of sinful life and at the same time awaken his original <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness. By coming home, taking his bath, eating nice foodstuffs, getting refreshed and searching out his wife, King <a href="/d/puranjana" class="d">Pura&ntilde;jana</a> came to his good consciousness in his family life. In other words, a systematic family life as enjoined in the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> is better than an irresponsible sinful life. If a husband and wife combine together in <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness and live together peacefully, that is very nice. However, if a husband becomes too much attracted by his wife and forgets his duty in life, the implications of materialistic life will again resume. &#346;r&#299;la <a href="/d/rupa" class="d">R&#363;pa</a> Gosv&#257;m&#299; has therefore recommended, <span class="Italic">an&#257;saktasya <a href="/d/visayan" class="d">vi&#7779;ay&#257;n</a></span> (<span class="Ref_Italic"><a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">Bhakti</a>-<a href="/d/rasamrta" class="d">ras&#257;m&#7771;ta</a>-<a href="/d/sindhu" class="d">sindhu</a></span> 1.2.255). Without being attached by sex, the husband and wife may live together for the advancement of spiritual life. The husband should engage in devotional service, and the wife should be faithful and religious according to the Vedic injunctions. Such a combination is very good. However, if the husband becomes too much attracted to the wife due to sex, the position becomes very dangerous. Women in general are very much sexually inclined. Indeed, it is said that a woman&rsquo;s sex desire is nine times stronger than a man&rsquo;s. It is therefore a man&rsquo;s duty to keep a woman under his control by satisfying her, giving her ornaments, nice food and clothes, and engaging her in religious activities. Of course, a woman should have a few children and in this way not be disturbing to the man. Unfortunately, if the man becomes attracted to the woman simply for sex enjoyment, then family life becomes abominable.</div>
<A NAME="62654"></A><div id="62654"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The great politician C&#257;&#7751;akya <a href="/d/pandita" class="d">Pa&#7751;&#7693;ita</a> has said: <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bharya" class="d">bh&#257;ry&#257;</a> <a href="/d/rupavati" class="d">r&#363;pavat&#299;</a> <a href="/d/satruh" class="d">&#347;atru&#7717;</a></span>&mdash;a beautiful wife is an enemy. Of course every woman in the eyes of her husband is very beautiful. Others may see her as not very beautiful, but the husband, being very much attracted to her, sees her always as very beautiful. If the husband sees the wife as very beautiful, it is to be assumed that he is too much attracted to her. This attraction is the attraction of sex. The whole world is captivated by the two modes of material nature <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/rajo" class="d">rajo</a>-<a href="/d/guna" class="d">gu&#7751;a</a></span> and <span class="Italic">tamo-<a href="/d/guna" class="d">gu&#7751;a</a>,</span> passion and ignorance. Generally women are very much passionate and are less intelligent; therefore somehow or other a man should not be under the control of their passion and ignorance. By performing <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">bhakti</a>-<a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a>,</span> or devotional service, a man can be raised to the platform of goodness. If a husband situated in the mode of goodness can control his wife, who is in passion and ignorance, the woman is benefited. Forgetting her natural inclination for passion and ignorance, the woman becomes obedient and faithful to her husband, who is situated in goodness. Such a life becomes very welcome. The intelligence of the man and woman may then work very nicely together, and they can make a progressive march toward spiritual realization. Otherwise, the husband, coming under the control of the wife, sacrifices his quality of goodness and becomes subservient to the qualities of passion and ignorance. In this way the whole situation becomes polluted.</div>
<A NAME="62655"></A><div id="62655"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The conclusion is that a household life is better than a sinful life devoid of responsibility, but if in the household life the husband becomes subordinate to the wife, involvement in materialistic life again becomes prominent. In this way a man&rsquo;s material bondage becomes enhanced. Because of this, according to the Vedic system, after a certain age a man is recommended to abandon his family life for the stages of <span class="Italic">v&#257;naprastha</span> and <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sannyasa" class="d">sanny&#257;sa</a>.</span></div>
