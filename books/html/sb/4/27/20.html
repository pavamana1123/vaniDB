<div class="Translation">The daughter of Time [<a href="/d/jara" class="d">Jar&#257;</a>] was very unfortunate. Consequently she was known as <a href="/d/durbhaga" class="d">Durbhag&#257;</a> [&ldquo;ill-fated&rdquo;]. However, she was once pleased with a great king, and because the king accepted her, she granted him a great benediction.</div>

<div class="First">As Bhaktivinoda &#7788;h&#257;kura sings, <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/saba" class="d">saba</a> <a href="/d/sukha" class="d">sukha</a> bh&#257;gala:</span> all kinds of happiness disappear in old age. Consequently, no one likes old age, or <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/jara" class="d">jar&#257;</a>.</span> Thus <a href="/d/jara" class="d">Jar&#257;</a>, as the daughter of Time, is known as a most unfortunate daughter. She was, however, at one time accepted by a great king, Yay&#257;ti. Yay&#257;ti was cursed by his father-in-law, &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya, to accept her. When &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya&rsquo;s daughter was married to King Yay&#257;ti, one of her friends named &#346;armi&#7779;&#7789;h&#257; went with her. Later King Yay&#257;ti became very much attached to &#346;armi&#7779;&#7789;h&#257;, and &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya&rsquo;s daughter complained to her father. Consequently, &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya cursed King Yay&#257;ti to become prematurely old. King Yay&#257;ti had five youthful sons, and he begged all his sons to exchange their youth for his old age. No one agreed except the youngest son, whose name was <a href="/d/puru" class="d">P&#363;ru</a>. Upon accepting Yay&#257;ti&rsquo;s old age, <a href="/d/puru" class="d">P&#363;ru</a> was given the kingdom. It is said that two of Yay&#257;ti&rsquo;s other sons, being disobedient to their father, were given kingdoms outside of India, most probably Turkey and Greece. The purport is that one can accumulate wealth and all kinds of material opulences, but during old age one cannot enjoy them. Although <a href="/d/puru" class="d">P&#363;ru</a> attained his father&rsquo;s kingdom, he could not enjoy all the opulence, for he had sacrificed his youth. One should not wait for old age in order to become <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> conscious. Due to the invalidity of old age, one cannot make progress in <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness, however opulent he may be materially.</div>
