<div class="Translation">One who is conducted by false ego and thus always distressed, both mentally and sensually, cannot tolerate the opulence of self-realized persons. Being unable to rise to the standard of self-realization, he envies such persons as much as demons envy the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<A NAME="48545"></A><div id="48545"> </div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<A NAME="48546"></A><div id="48546"> </div>
<div class="First">The real reason for the enmity between Lord &#346;iva and <a href="/d/daksa" class="d">Dak&#7779;a</a> is explained here. <a href="/d/daksa" class="d">Dak&#7779;a</a> was envious of Lord &#346;iva because of &#346;iva&rsquo;s high position as an incarnation of a quality of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and because &#346;iva was directly in contact with the Supersoul and was therefore honored and given a better sitting place than he. There were many other reasons also. <a href="/d/daksa" class="d">Dak&#7779;a</a>, being materially puffed up, could not tolerate the high position of Lord &#346;iva, so his anger at Lord &#346;iva&rsquo;s not standing up in his presence was only the final manifestation of his envy. Lord &#346;iva is always in meditation and always perceives the Supersoul, as expressed here by the words <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/purusa" class="d">p&#363;ru&#7779;a</a>-<a href="/d/buddhi" class="d">buddhi</a>-<a href="/d/saksinam" class="d">s&#257;k&#7779;i&#7751;&#257;m</a>.</span> The position of one whose intelligence is always absorbed in meditation upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead is very great and cannot be imitated by anyone, especially an ordinary person. When <a href="/d/daksa" class="d">Dak&#7779;a</a> entered the arena of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yajna" class="d">yaj&ntilde;a</a>,</span> Lord &#346;iva was in meditation and might not have seen <a href="/d/daksa" class="d">Dak&#7779;a</a> enter, but <a href="/d/daksa" class="d">Dak&#7779;a</a> took the opportunity to curse him because <a href="/d/daksa" class="d">Dak&#7779;a</a> had maintained an envious attitude towards Lord &#346;iva for a long time. Those who are actually self-realized see every individual body as a temple of the Supreme Personality of Godhead because the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in His <a href="/d/paramatma" class="d">Param&#257;tm&#257;</a> feature, is residing in everyone&rsquo;s body.</div>
<A NAME="48547"></A><div id="48547"> </div>
<div class="Purport">When one offers respect to the body, it is not to the material body but to the presence of the Supreme Lord. Thus one who is always in meditation upon the Supreme Lord is always offering Him obeisances. But since <a href="/d/daksa" class="d">Dak&#7779;a</a> was not very elevated, he thought that obeisances were offered to the material body, and because Lord &#346;iva did not offer respect to his material body, <a href="/d/daksa" class="d">Dak&#7779;a</a> became envious. Such persons, being unable to rise to the standard of self-realized souls like Lord &#346;iva, are always envious. The example given here is very suitable. <span class="Italic">Asuras,</span> demons or atheists, are always envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; they simply want to kill Him. Even in this age we find some so-called scholars commenting on <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> who are envious of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. When <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> says, <span class="Italic">man-<a href="/d/mana" class="d">man&#257;</a> <a href="/d/bhava" class="d">bhava</a> <a href="/d/mad" class="d">mad</a>-<a href="/d/bhaktah" class="d">bhakta&#7717;</a></span> (Bg. <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/18/65?d=1">18.65</a>)&mdash;&ldquo;Always think of Me, become My devotee, and surrender unto Me&rdquo;&mdash;the so-called scholars comment that it is not to <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> that we have to surrender. That is envy. The <span class="Italic">asuras</span> or atheists, the demons, without reason or cause, are envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, instead of offering respect to self-realized persons, foolish men who cannot approach the highest standard of self-realization are always envious, although there is no reason.</div>
