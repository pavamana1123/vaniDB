<div class="Translation">My dear lord, I am very impudent for not accepting your instructions, but this is not my fault. It is due to my having been born in a <a href="/d/ksatriya" class="d">k&#7779;atriya</a> family. My stepmother, Suruci, has pierced my heart with her harsh words. Therefore your valuable instruction does not stand in my heart.</div>
<A NAME="51294"></A><div id="51294"> </div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<A NAME="51295"></A><div id="51295"> </div>
<div class="First">It is said that the heart or mind is just like an earthen pot; once broken, it cannot be repaired by any means. <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> gave this example to <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a>. He said that his heart, having been pierced by the arrows of his stepmother&rsquo;s harsh words, felt so broken that nothing seemed valuable but his desire to counteract her insult. His stepmother had said that because he was born from the womb of Sun&#299;ti, a neglected queen of <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> Utt&#257;nap&#257;da, <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> was not fit to sit either on the throne or on his father&rsquo;s lap. In other words, according to his stepmother, he could not be declared king. <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s determination, therefore, was to become king of a planet exalted even beyond that possessed by Lord <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a>, the greatest of all the demigods.</div>
<A NAME="51296"></A><div id="51296"> </div>
<div class="Purport"><a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> indirectly informed the great sage <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> that there are four kinds of human spirit&mdash;the brahminical spirit, the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/ksatriya" class="d">k&#7779;atriya</a></span> spirit, the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/vaisya" class="d">vai&#347;ya</a></span> spirit and the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sudra" class="d">&#347;&#363;dra</a></span> spirit. The spirit of one <a href="/d/caste" class="d">caste</a> is not applicable to the members of another. The philosophical spirit enunciated by <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> might have been suitable for a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> spirit, but it was not suitable for a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/ksatriya" class="d">k&#7779;atriya</a>.</span> <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> frankly admitted that he was lacking in brahminical humility and was therefore unable to accept the philosophy of <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a>.</div>
<A NAME="51297"></A><div id="51297"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The statements of <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> indicate that unless a child is trained according to his tendency, there is no possibility of his developing his particular spirit. It was the duty of the spiritual master or teacher to observe the psychological movement of a particular boy and thus train him in a particular occupational duty. <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a>, having already been trained in the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/ksatriya" class="d">k&#7779;atriya</a></span> spirit, would not accept the brahminical philosophy. In America we have practical experience of this incompatibility of the brahminical and <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/ksatriya" class="d">k&#7779;atriya</a></span> temperaments. The American boys, who have simply been trained as <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras,</span> are not at all fit to fight in battle. Therefore, when they are called to join the military, they refuse because they do not have <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/ksatriya" class="d">k&#7779;atriya</a></span> spirit. This is a cause of great dissatisfaction in society.</div>
<A NAME="51298"></A><div id="51298"> </div>
<div class="Purport">That the boys do not have the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/ksatriya" class="d">k&#7779;atriya</a></span> spirit does not mean that they are trained in brahminical qualities; they are trained as <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras,</span> and thus in frustration they are becoming hippies. However, as soon as they enter the <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness movement being started in America, they are trained to meet the brahminical qualifications, even though they have fallen to the lowest conditions as <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras.</span> In other words, since the <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness movement is open for everyone, people in general can attain the brahminical qualifications. This is the greatest need at the present moment, for now there are actually no <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> or <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas</span> but only some <span class="Italic">vai&#347;yas</span> and, for the most part, <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras.</span> The classification of society into <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as, k&#7779;atriyas, vai&#347;yas</span> and <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span> is very scientific. In the human social body, the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> are considered the head, the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas</span> are the arms, the <span class="Italic">vai&#347;yas</span> are the belly, and the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span> are the legs. At the present moment the body has legs and a belly, but there are no arms or head, and therefore society is topsy-turvy. It is necessary to reestablish the brahminical qualifications in order to raise the fallen human society to the highest standard of spiritual consciousness.</div>
