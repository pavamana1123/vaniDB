<div class="First">The description of King Utt&#257;nap&#257;da&rsquo;s palace depicts the state of affairs many hundreds and thousands of years ago, long before <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a></span> was compiled. Since it is described that <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> ruled for thirty-six thousand years, he must have lived in the <a href="/d/satya" class="d">Satya</a>-<a href="/d/yuga" class="d">yuga</a>, when people lived for one hundred thousand years. The life durations in the four <span class="Italic">yugas</span> are also mentioned in the Vedic literature. In the <a href="/d/satya" class="d">Satya</a>-<a href="/d/yuga" class="d">yuga</a> people used to live for one hundred thousand years, in the <a href="/d/treta" class="d">Tret&#257;</a>-<a href="/d/yuga" class="d">yuga</a> people lived for ten thousand years, in <a href="/d/dvapara" class="d">Dv&#257;para</a>-<a href="/d/yuga" class="d">yuga</a> they lived for one thousand years, and in this age, <a href="/d/kali" class="d">Kali</a>-<a href="/d/yuga" class="d">yuga</a>, people may live up to one hundred years. With the progressive advance of each new <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yuga" class="d">yuga</a>,</span> the duration of human life is reduced by ninety percent&mdash;from one hundred thousand to ten thousand, from ten thousand to one thousand, and from one thousand to one hundred.</div>
<A NAME="52687"></A><div id="52687"> </div>
<div class="Purport">It is said that <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> was the great-grandson of Lord <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a>. This indicates that <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s time was in the <a href="/d/satya" class="d">Satya</a>-<a href="/d/yuga" class="d">yuga</a> in the beginning of creation. During one day of Lord <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a>, as stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a>,</span> there are many <a href="/d/satya" class="d">Satya</a>-yugas. According to the Vedic calculation, at the present moment the twenty-eighth millennium is current. It can be calculated that <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> lived many millions of years ago, but the description of the palace of Dhruva&rsquo;s father is so glorious that we cannot accept that advanced human civilization did not exist even forty or fifty thousand years ago. There were walls like those in the palace of <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> Utt&#257;nap&#257;da even very recently, during the Mogul period. Anyone who has seen the Red Fort in Delhi must have marked that the walls are made of marble and were once decorated with jewels. During the British period all these jewels were taken away and dispatched to the British Museum.</div>
<A NAME="52688"></A><div id="52688"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The conception of worldly opulence was formerly based mainly on natural resources such as jewels, marble, silk, ivory, gold and silver. The advancement of economic development was not based on big motorcars. Advancement of human civilization depends not on industrial enterprises, but on possession of natural wealth and natural food, which is all supplied by the Supreme Personality of Godhead so that we may save time for self-realization and success in the human form of body.</div>
<A NAME="52689"></A><div id="52689"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Another aspect of this verse is that <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s father, Utt&#257;nap&#257;da, would very soon give up attachment for his palaces and would go to the forest for self-realization. From the description of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a>,</span> therefore, we can make a very thorough comparative study of modern civilization and the civilization of mankind in the other millenniums, <a href="/d/satya" class="d">Satya</a>-<a href="/d/yuga" class="d">yuga</a>, <a href="/d/treta" class="d">Tret&#257;</a>-<a href="/d/yuga" class="d">yuga</a> and <a href="/d/dvapara" class="d">Dv&#257;para</a>-<a href="/d/yuga" class="d">yuga</a>.</div>
