<div class="Translation"><a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> said: My dear Lord, You are all-powerful. After entering within me, You have enlivened all my sleeping senses&mdash;my hands, legs, ears, touch sensation, life force and especially my power of speech. Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto You.</div>

<div class="First"><a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> could understand very easily the difference between his condition before and after attaining spiritual realization and seeing the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face. He could understand that his life force and activities had been sleeping. Unless one comes to the spiritual platform, his bodily limbs, mind and other facilities within the body are understood to be sleeping. Unless one is spiritually situated, all his activities are taken as a dead man&rsquo;s activities or ghostly activities. &#346;r&#299;la Bhaktivinoda &#7788;h&#257;kura has composed a song in which he addresses himself: &ldquo;O living entity, get up! How long shall you sleep on the lap of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/maya" class="d">m&#257;y&#257;</a></span>? Now you have the opportunity of possessing a human form of body; now try to get up and realize yourself.&rdquo; The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> also declare, &ldquo;Get up! Get up! You have the opportunity, the boon of the human form of life&mdash;now realize yourself.&rdquo; These are the Vedic injunctions.</div>
<A NAME="51980"></A><div id="51980"> </div>
<div class="Purport"><a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> actually experienced that upon enlightenment of his senses on the spiritual platform he could understand the essence of Vedic instruction&mdash;that the Supreme Godhead is the Supreme Person; He is not impersonal. <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> could immediately understand this fact. He was aware that for a very long time he was practically sleeping, and he felt the impetus to glorify the Lord according to the Vedic conclusion. A mundane person cannot offer any prayer or glorify the Supreme Personality of Godhead, because he has no realization of the Vedic conclusion.</div>
<A NAME="51981"></A><div id="51981"> </div>
<div class="Purport">When <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a>, therefore, found this difference within himself, he could immediately understand that it was because of the causeless mercy of the Lord. He offered obeisances to the Lord with great respect and reverence, completely understanding that the Lord&rsquo;s favor was upon him. This spiritual enlivenment of <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s senses and mind was due to the action of the internal potency of the Lord. In this verse, therefore, the word <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sva" class="d">sva</a>-<a href="/d/dhamna" class="d">dh&#257;mn&#257;</a></span> means &ldquo;by spiritual energy.&rdquo; Spiritual enlightenment is possible by the mercy of the spiritual energy of the Lord. The chanting of the <a href="/d/hare" class="d">Hare</a> <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/mantra" class="d">mantra</a></span> is first addressed to the spiritual energy of the Lord, <a href="/d/hare" class="d">Hare</a>. This spiritual energy acts when a living entity fully surrenders and accepts his position as an eternal servitor. When a person places himself at the disposal or order of the Supreme Lord, that is called <span class="Italic">sevonmukha;</span> at that time the spiritual energy gradually reveals the Lord to him.</div>
<A NAME="51982"></A><div id="51982"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Without revelation by the spiritual energy, one is unable to offer prayers glorifying the Lord. Any amount of philosophical speculation or poetic expression by mundane persons is still considered to be the action and reaction of the material energy. When one is actually enlivened by the spiritual energy, all his senses become purified, and he engages only in the service of the Lord. At that time his hands, legs, ears, tongue, mind, genitals&mdash;everything&mdash;engage in the service of the Lord. Such an enlightened devotee no longer has any material activities, nor has he any interest in being materially engaged. This process of purifying the senses and engaging them in the service of the Lord is known as <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">bhakti</a>,</span> or devotional service. In the beginning, the senses are engaged by the direction of the spiritual master and <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sastra" class="d">&#347;&#257;stra</a>,</span> and after realization, when the same senses are purified, the engagement continues. The difference is that in the beginning the senses are engaged in a mechanical way, but after realization they are engaged in spiritual understanding.</div>
