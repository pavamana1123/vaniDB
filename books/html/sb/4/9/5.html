<div class="Translation">At that time <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> became perfectly aware of the Vedic conclusion and understood the Absolute Truth and His relationship with all living entities. In accordance with the line of devotional service to the Supreme Lord, whose fame is widespread, <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a>, who in the future would receive a planet which would never be annihilated, even during the time of dissolution, offered his deliberate and conclusive prayers.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<A NAME="51964"></A><div id="51964"> </div>
<div class="First">There are many important items to be considered in this verse. First of all, the relationship between the Absolute Truth and the relative material and spiritual energies is here understood by a student who has complete knowledge of the Vedic literature. <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> never went to any school or academic teacher to learn the Vedic conclusion, but because of his devotional service to the Lord, as soon as the Lord appeared and touched his forehead with His conchshell, automatically the entire Vedic conclusion was revealed to him. That is the process of understanding Vedic literature. One cannot understand it simply by academic learning. The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> indicate that only to one who has unflinching faith in the Supreme Lord as well as in the spiritual master is the Vedic conclusion revealed.</div>
<A NAME="51965"></A><div id="51965"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The example of <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> is that he engaged himself in devotional service to the Lord according to the order of his spiritual master, <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a>. As a result of his rendering such devotional service with great determination and austerity, the Personality of Godhead personally manifested Himself before him. <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> was only a child. He wanted to offer nice prayers to the Lord, but because he lacked sufficient knowledge, he hesitated; but by the mercy of the Lord, as soon as the Lord&rsquo;s conchshell touched his forehead, he became completely aware of the Vedic conclusion. That conclusion is based on proper understanding of the difference between <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/jiva" class="d">j&#299;va</a></span> and <a href="/d/paramatma" class="d">Param&#257;tm&#257;</a>, the individual soul and the Supersoul. The individual soul is forever a servant of the Supersoul, and therefore his relationship with the Supersoul is to offer service. That is called <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">bhakti</a>-<a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a>,</span> or <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">bhakti</a>-<a href="/d/bhava" class="d">bh&#257;va</a>.</span> <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> offered his prayers to the Lord not in the way of the impersonalist philosophers, but as a devotee. Therefore, it is clearly said here, <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">bhakti</a>-<a href="/d/bhava" class="d">bh&#257;va</a>.</span> The only prayers worth offering are those offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose reputation is spread far and wide. <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> wanted to have the kingdom of his father, but his father refused even to allow him to get on his lap. In order to fulfill his desire, the Lord had already created a planet known as the polestar, Dhruvaloka, which was never to be annihilated even at the time of the dissolution of the universe. <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> attained this perfection not by acting hastily, but by patiently executing the order of his spiritual master, and therefore he became so successful that he saw the Lord face to face. Now he was further enabled, by the causeless mercy of the Lord, to offer fitting prayers to the Lord. To glorify or offer prayers unto the Supreme, one needs the Lord&rsquo;s mercy. One cannot write to glorify the Lord unless one is endowed with His causeless mercy.</div>
