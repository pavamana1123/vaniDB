<div class="Translation">Since all the demigods who are situated in the higher planetary system will have to come down again, they are all envious of my being elevated to Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;haloka by devotional service. These intolerant demigods have dissipated my intelligence, and only for this reason could I not accept the genuine benediction of the instructions of Sage <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a>.</div>
<A NAME="52341"></A><div id="52341"> </div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<A NAME="52342"></A><div id="52342"> </div>
<div class="First">As shown by many instances in the Vedic literature, when a person undergoes severe austerities, the demigods become very much perturbed because they are always afraid of losing their posts as the predominating deities of the heavenly planets. It is known to them that their position in the higher planetary system is impermanent, as it is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a>,</span> Ninth Chapter (<span class="Italic"><a href="/d/ksine" class="d">k&#7779;&#299;&#7751;e</a> <a href="/d/punye" class="d">pu&#7751;ye</a> <a href="/d/martya" class="d">martya</a>-<a href="/d/lokam" class="d">loka&#7745;</a> <a href="/d/visanti" class="d">vi&#347;anti</a></span>). It is said in the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/gita" class="d">G&#299;t&#257;</a></span> that after exhausting the results of their pious activities, all the demigods, who are inhabitants of the higher planetary system, have to come back again to this earth.</div>
<A NAME="52343"></A><div id="52343"> </div>
<div class="Purport">It is a fact that the demigods control the different activities of the limbs of our bodies. Factually we are not free even in moving our eyelids. Everything is controlled by them. <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s conclusion is that these demigods, being envious of his superior position in devotional service, conspired against him to pollute his intelligence, and thus although he was the disciple of a great <a href="/d/vaisnava" class="d">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava</a>, <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a>, he could not accept N&#257;rada&rsquo;s valid instructions. Now <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> regretted very much that he had neglected these instructions. <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> had asked him, &ldquo;Why should you bother about insult or adoration from your stepmother?&rdquo; He of course said to <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> that since <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> was only a child, what did he have to do with such insult or adoration? But <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> was determined to achieve the benediction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> advised him to go back home for the time being, and in mature time he could try to practice devotional service. <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> regretted that he had rejected the advice of <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> and was adamant in asking him for something perishable, namely revenge against his stepmother for her insult, and possession of the kingdom of his father.</div>
<A NAME="52344"></A><div id="52344"> </div>
<div class="Purport"><a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> regretted very much that he could not take seriously the instruction of his spiritual master and that his consciousness was therefore contaminated. Still, the Lord is so merciful that due to Dhruva&rsquo;s execution of devotional service He offered <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> the ultimate <a href="/d/vaisnava" class="d">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava</a> goal.</div>
