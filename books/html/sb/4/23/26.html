<div class="First">Both <a href="/d/prthu" class="d">P&#7771;thu</a> Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s airplane and the airplane carrying Queen Arci were passing out of the vision of the ladies of the higher planetary systems. These ladies were simply astonished to see how <a href="/d/prthu" class="d">P&#7771;thu</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> and his wife achieved such an exalted position. Although they were the wives of the denizens of the higher planetary system and <a href="/d/prthu" class="d">P&#7771;thu</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> was an inhabitant of an inferior planetary system (the earth), the King, along with his wife, passed beyond the realms of the demigods and went upward to Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;haloka. The word <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/urdhvam" class="d">&#363;rdhvam</a></span> (&ldquo;upward&rdquo;) is significant here, for the ladies speaking were from the higher planetary systems, which include the moon, sun and Venus, up to Brahmaloka, or the highest planet. Beyond Brahmaloka is the spiritual sky, and in that spiritual sky there are innumerable Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;halokas. Thus the word <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/urdhvam" class="d">&#363;rdhvam</a></span> indicates that the <a href="/d/vaikuntha" class="d">Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha</a> planets are beyond or above these material planets, and it was to these <a href="/d/vaikuntha" class="d">Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha</a> planets that <a href="/d/prthu" class="d">P&#7771;thu</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> and his wife were going. This also indicates that when <a href="/d/prthu" class="d">P&#7771;thu</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> and his wife, Arci, abandoned their material bodies in the material fire, they immediately developed their spiritual bodies and entered into spiritual airplanes, which could penetrate the material elements and reach the spiritual sky. Since they were carried by two separate airplanes, it may be concluded that even after being burned in the funeral pyre they remained separate, individual persons. In other words, they never lost their identity or became void, as imagined by the impersonalists.</div>
<A NAME="60009"></A><div id="60009"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The ladies in the higher planetary systems were capable of seeing both downward and upward. When they looked down they could see that the body of <a href="/d/prthu" class="d">P&#7771;thu</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> was being burned and that his wife, Arci, was entering into the fire, and when they looked upward they could see how they were being carried in two airplanes to the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;halokas. All of this is possible simply by <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/durvibhavyena" class="d">durvibh&#257;vyena</a> <a href="/d/karmana" class="d">karma&#7751;&#257;</a>,</span> inconceivable activity. <a href="/d/prthu" class="d">P&#7771;thu</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> was a pure devotee, and his wife, Queen Arci, simply followed her husband. Thus they can both be considered pure devotees, and thus they are capable of performing inconceivable activities. Such activities are not possible for ordinary men. Indeed, ordinary men cannot even take to the devotional service of the Lord, nor can ordinary women maintain such vows of chastity and follow their husbands in all respects. A woman does not need to attain high qualifications, but if she simply follows in the footsteps of her husband, who must be a devotee, then both husband and wife attain liberation and are promoted to the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;halokas. This is evinced by the inconceivable activities of <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/prthu" class="d">P&#7771;thu</a> and his wife.</div>
