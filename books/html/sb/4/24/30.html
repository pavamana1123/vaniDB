<div class="Translation">You are all devotees of the Lord, and as such I appreciate that you are as respectable as the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. I know in this way that the devotees also respect me and that I am dear to them. Thus no one can be as dear to the devotees as I am.</div>

<div class="First">It is said, <span class="Italic">vai&#7779;&#7751;av&#257;n&#257;&#7745; <a href="/d/yatha" class="d">yath&#257;</a> <a href="/d/sambhuh" class="d">&#347;ambhu&#7717;</a>:</span> Lord &#346;iva is the best of all devotees. Therefore all devotees of Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> are also devotees of Lord &#346;iva. In <a href="/d/vrndavana" class="d">V&#7771;nd&#257;vana</a> there is Lord &#346;iva&rsquo;s temple called Gop&#299;&#347;vara. The <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> used to worship not only Lord &#346;iva but K&#257;ty&#257;yan&#299;, or <a href="/d/durga" class="d">Durg&#257;</a>, as well, but their aim was to attain the favor of Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. A devotee of Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> does not disrespect Lord &#346;iva, but worships Lord &#346;iva as the most exalted devotee of Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. Consequently whenever a devotee worships Lord &#346;iva, he prays to Lord &#346;iva to achieve the favor of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, and he does not request material profit. In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/7/20?d=1">7.20</a>) it is said that generally people worship demigods for some material profit. <span class="Italic">K&#257;mais tais tair <a href="/d/hrta" class="d">h&#7771;ta</a> <a href="/d/jnanah" class="d">j&ntilde;&#257;n&#257;&#7717;</a>.</span> Driven by material lust, they worship demigods, but a devotee never does so, for he is never driven by material lust. That is the difference between a devotee&rsquo;s respect for Lord &#346;iva and an <span class="Italic">asura&rsquo;s</span> respect for him. The <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/asura" class="d">asura</a></span> worships Lord &#346;iva, takes some benediction from him, misuses the benediction and ultimately is killed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who awards him liberation.</div>
<A NAME="60619"></A><div id="60619"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Because Lord &#346;iva is a great devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he loves all the devotees of the Supreme Lord. Lord &#346;iva told the Pracet&#257;s that because they were devotees of the Lord, he loved them very much. Lord &#346;iva was not kind and merciful only to the Pracet&#257;s; anyone who is a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is very dear to Lord &#346;iva. Not only are the devotees dear to Lord &#346;iva, but he respects them as much as he respects the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, devotees of the Supreme Lord also worship Lord &#346;iva as the most dear devotee of Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. They do not worship him as a separate Personality of Godhead. It is stated in the list of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/nama" class="d">n&#257;ma</a>-apar&#257;dhas</span> that it is an offense to think that the chanting of the name of <a href="/d/hari" class="d">Hari</a> and the chanting of <a href="/d/hara" class="d">Hara</a>, or &#346;iva, are the same. The devotees must always know that Lord <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a> is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that Lord &#346;iva is His devotee. A devotee should be offered respect on the level of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and sometimes even more respect. Indeed, Lord <a href="/d/rama" class="d">R&#257;ma</a>, the Personality of Godhead Himself, sometimes worshiped Lord &#346;iva. If a devotee is worshiped by the Lord, why should a devotee not be worshiped by other devotees on the same level with the Lord? This is the conclusion. From this verse it appears that Lord &#346;iva blesses the <span class="Italic">asuras</span> simply for the sake of formality. Actually he loves one who is devoted to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
