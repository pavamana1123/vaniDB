<A NAME="60538"></A><div id="60538"> </div>
<div class="Translation">The Pracet&#257;s were fortunate to see Lord &#346;iva, the chief of the demigods, emerging from the water with his associates. His bodily luster was just like molten gold, his throat was bluish, and he had three eyes, which looked very mercifully upon his devotees. He was accompanied by many musicians, who were glorifying him. As soon as the Pracet&#257;s saw Lord &#346;iva, they immediately offered their obeisances in great amazement and fell down at the lotus feet of the lord.</div>
<A NAME="60539"></A><div id="60539"> </div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<A NAME="60540"></A><div id="60540"> </div>
<div class="First">The word <span class="Italic">vibudh&#257;nugai&#7717;</span> indicates that Lord &#346;iva is always accompanied by the denizens of the higher planets known as Gandharvas and Kinnaras. They are very expert in musical science, and Lord &#346;iva is worshiped by them constantly. In pictures, Lord &#346;iva is generally painted white, but here we find that the color of his skin is not exactly white but like molten gold, or a glowing yellowish color. Because Lord &#346;iva is always very, very merciful, his name is &#256;&#347;uto&#7779;a. Amongst all the demigods, Lord &#346;iva can be pacified even by the lowest class of men, who need only offer him obeisances and leaves of a bael tree. Thus his name is &#256;&#347;uto&#7779;a, which means that he is pleased very quickly.</div>
<A NAME="60541"></A><div id="60541"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Generally those who are very fond of material prosperity approach Lord &#346;iva for such benediction. The lord, being very merciful, quickly awards all the blessings the devotee asks of him. The demons take advantage of this leniency and sometimes take benedictions from Lord &#346;iva which can be very dangerous to others. For instance, V&#7771;k&#257;sura took a benediction from Lord &#346;iva by which he could kill everyone he touched on the head. Although Lord &#346;iva sometimes very liberally gives such benedictions to his devotees, the difficulty is that the demons, being very cunning, sometimes want to experiment improperly with such benedictions. For instance, after receiving his benediction, V&#7771;k&#257;sura tried to touch the head of Lord &#346;iva. Devotees of Lord <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a>, however, have no desire for such benedictions, and Lord <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a> does not give His devotees benedictions which would cause disturbance to the whole world.</div>
