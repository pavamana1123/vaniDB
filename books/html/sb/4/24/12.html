<div class="Translation">While &#346;atadruti was thus being married, the demons, the denizens of Gandharvaloka, the great sages, and the denizens of Siddhaloka, the earthly planets and N&#257;galoka, although highly exalted, were all captivated by the tinkling of her ankle bells.</div>

<div class="First">Generally a woman becomes more beautiful when, after an early marriage, she gives birth to a child. To give birth to a child is the natural function of a woman, and therefore a woman becomes more and more beautiful as she gives birth to one child after another. In the case of &#346;atadruti, however, she was so beautiful that she attracted the whole universe at her marriage ceremony. Indeed, she attracted all the learned and exalted demigods simply by the tinkling of her ankle bells. This indicates that all the demigods wanted to see her beauty completely, but they were not able to see it because she was fully dressed and covered with ornaments. Since they could only see the feet of &#346;atadruti, they became attracted by her ankle bells, which tinkled as she walked. In other words, the demigods became captivated by her simply by hearing the tinkling of her ankle bells. They did not have to see her complete beauty. It is sometimes understood that a person becomes lusty just by hearing the tinkling of bangles on the hands of women or the tinkling of ankle bells, or just by seeing a woman&rsquo;s <a href="/d/sari" class="d">sari</a>. Thus it is concluded that woman is the complete representation of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/maya" class="d">m&#257;y&#257;</a>.</span> Although <a href="/d/visvamitra" class="d">Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> was engaged in practicing mystic <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> with closed eyes, his transcendental meditation was broken when he heard the tinkling of bangles on the hands of Menak&#257;. In this way <a href="/d/visvamitra" class="d">Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> became a victim of Menak&#257; and fathered a child who is universally celebrated as &#346;akuntal&#257;. The conclusion is that no one can save himself from the attraction of woman, even though he be an exalted demigod or an inhabitant of the higher planets. Only a devotee of the Lord, who is attracted by <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, can escape the lures of woman. Once one is attracted by <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, the illusory energy of the world cannot attract him.</div>
