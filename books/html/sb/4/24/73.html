<div class="Translation">When all the Praj&#257;patis were ordered to create by Lord <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a>, we chanted these prayers in praise of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and became completely free from all ignorance. Thus we were able to create different types of living entities.</div>

<div class="First">In this verse we can understand that the various types of living entities were created simultaneously at the very beginning of the creation. The nonsensical Darwinian theory of evolution is not applicable here. It is not that intelligent human beings did not exist millions of years ago. On the contrary, it is understood that the most intelligent creature, Lord <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a>, was first created. Then Lord <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> created other saintly sages like <a href="/d/marici" class="d">Mar&#299;ci</a>, <a href="/d/bhrgu" class="d">Bh&#7771;gu</a>, &#256;treya, <a href="/d/vasistha" class="d">Vasi&#7779;&#7789;ha</a> and Lord &#346;iva. They in their turn created different types of bodies according to <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/karma" class="d">karma</a>.</span> In <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a></span> Lord Kapiladeva told His mother that the living entity gets a particular type of body in accordance with his work and that this body is decided upon by higher authorities. The higher authorities, as appointed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are Lord <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> and all other Praj&#257;patis and Manus. Thus from the beginning of creation it can be seen that the first creature is the most intelligent. It is not that so-called modern intelligence has developed by the gradual process of evolution. As stated in <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahma</a>-vaivarta <a href="/d/purana" class="d">Pur&#257;&#7751;a</a>,</span> there is a gradual evolutionary process, but it is not the body that is evolving. All the bodily forms are already there. It is the spiritual entity, or spiritual spark within the body, that is being promoted by the laws of nature under the supervision of superior authority. We can understand from this verse that from the very beginning of creation different varieties of living entities were existing. It is not that some of them have become extinct. Everything is there; it is due to our lack of knowledge that we cannot see things in their proper perspective.</div>
<A NAME="61293"></A><div id="61293"> </div>
<div class="Purport">In this verse the word <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/dhvasta" class="d">dhvasta</a>-<a href="/d/tamasah" class="d">tamasa&#7717;</a></span> is very important, for without being free of ignorance one cannot control the creation of different types of living entities. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a></span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/3/31/1?d=1">3.31.1</a>), <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/daiva" class="d">daiva</a>-<a href="/d/netrena" class="d">netre&#7751;a</a></span>&mdash;bodies are awarded under the supervision of superior powers. How can these superior powers control the evolutionary process of the living entity if they are not free from all imperfection? The followers of the Vedic instructions cannot accept the Darwinian theory of evolution, for it is marred by imperfect knowledge.</div>
