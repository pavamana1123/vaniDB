<div class="Translation">King <a href="/d/puranjana" class="d">Pura&ntilde;jana</a> then began to think of his past dealings with his wife. He recalled that his wife would not take her dinner until he had finished his, that she would not take her bath until he had finished his, and that she was always very much attached to him, so much so that if he would sometimes become angry and chastise her, she would simply remain silent and tolerate his misbehavior.</div>

<div class="First">A wife is always supposed to be submissive to her husband. Submission, mild behavior and subservience are qualities in a wife which make a husband very thoughtful of her. For family life it is very good for a husband to be attached to his wife, but it is not very good for spiritual advancement. Thus <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness must be established in every home. If a husband and wife are very much attached to one another in <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness, they will both benefit because <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is the center of their existence. Otherwise, if the husband is too much attached to his wife, he becomes a woman in his next life. The woman, being overly attached to her husband, becomes a man in her next life. Of course, it is an advantage for a woman to become a man, but it is not at all advantageous for the man to become a woman.</div>
