<div class="Translation">Although she was received by her sisters and mother, she did not reply to their words of reception, and although she was offered a seat and presents, she did not accept anything, for her father neither talked with her nor welcomed her by asking about her welfare.</div>

<div class="First"><a href="/d/sati" class="d">Sat&#299;</a> did not accept the greetings offered by her sisters and mother, for she was not at all satisfied by her father&rsquo;s silence. <a href="/d/sati" class="d">Sat&#299;</a> was the youngest child of <a href="/d/daksa" class="d">Dak&#7779;a</a>, and she knew that she was his pet. But now, because of her association with Lord &#346;iva, <a href="/d/daksa" class="d">Dak&#7779;a</a> forgot all his affection for his daughter, and this very much aggrieved her. The material bodily conception is so polluted that even upon slight provocation all our relationships of love and affection are nullified. Bodily relationships are so transient that even though one is affectionate towards someone in a bodily relationship, a slight provocation terminates this intimacy.</div>
