<div class="Translation">Maitreya said: When Lord &#346;iva heard from <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> that <a href="/d/sati" class="d">Sat&#299;</a>, his wife, was now dead because of <a href="/d/prajapati" class="d">Praj&#257;pati</a> Dak&#7779;a&rsquo;s insult to her and that his soldiers had been driven away by the &#7770;bhu demigods, he became greatly angry.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<A NAME="49074"></A><div id="49074"> </div>
<div class="First">Lord &#346;iva understood that <a href="/d/sati" class="d">Sat&#299;</a>, being the youngest daughter of <a href="/d/daksa" class="d">Dak&#7779;a</a>, could present the case of Lord &#346;iva&rsquo;s purity of purpose and would thus be able to mitigate the misunderstanding between <a href="/d/daksa" class="d">Dak&#7779;a</a> and himself. But such a compromise was not attained, and <a href="/d/sati" class="d">Sat&#299;</a> was deliberately insulted by her father by not being received properly when she visited his house without being invited. <a href="/d/sati" class="d">Sat&#299;</a> herself could have killed her father, <a href="/d/daksa" class="d">Dak&#7779;a</a>, because she is the personified material energy and has immense power to kill and create within this material universe. In the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahma</a>-<a href="/d/samhita" class="d">sa&#7745;hit&#257;</a></span> her strength is described: she is capable of creating and dissolving many universes. But although she is so powerful, she acts under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, as His shadow. It would not have been difficult for <a href="/d/sati" class="d">Sat&#299;</a> to punish her father, but she thought that since she was his daughter, it was not proper for her to kill him. Thus she decided to give up her own body, which she had obtained from his, and <a href="/d/daksa" class="d">Dak&#7779;a</a> did not even check her.</div>
<A NAME="49075"></A><div id="49075"> </div>
<div class="Purport">When <a href="/d/sati" class="d">Sat&#299;</a> passed away, giving up her body, the news was conveyed by <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> to Lord &#346;iva. <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> always carries the news of such events because he knows their import. When Lord &#346;iva heard that his chaste wife, <a href="/d/sati" class="d">Sat&#299;</a>, was dead, he naturally became exceedingly angry. He also understood that <a href="/d/bhrgu" class="d">Bh&#7771;gu</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> had created the &#7770;bhudeva demigods by uttering the <span class="Italic">mantras</span> of the <span class="Italic">Yajur <a href="/d/veda" class="d">Veda</a></span> and that these demigods had driven away all of his soldiers who were present in the arena of sacrifice. Therefore, he wanted to reply to this insult, and thus he decided to kill <a href="/d/daksa" class="d">Dak&#7779;a</a> because he was the cause of the death of <a href="/d/sati" class="d">Sat&#299;</a>.</div>
