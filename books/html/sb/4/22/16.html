<div class="First">There are different kinds of transcendentalists, namely the <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;s,</span> or impersonalists, the mystic <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> and, of course, all the devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Kum&#257;ras, however, were both <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> and <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;s</span> and finally <span class="Italic">bhaktas</span> later on. In the beginning they were impersonalists, but later they developed devotional activities; therefore they are the best of the transcendentalists. The devotees are representatives of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and to elevate the conditioned souls to their original consciousness, they travel all over the universes to enlighten the conditioned souls about <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness. The best devotees are <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/atmavat" class="d">&#257;tmavat</a>,</span> or those who have fully realized the Supreme Soul. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, as <a href="/d/paramatma" class="d">Param&#257;tm&#257;</a>, is sitting within everyone&rsquo;s heart, trying to elevate everyone to the platform of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness. Therefore He is called <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/atma" class="d">&#257;tma</a>-<a href="/d/bhavana" class="d">bh&#257;vana</a>.</span> The Supreme Personality of Godhead is always trying to give the individual soul the intelligence to understand about Himself. He is always with the individual as a friend sitting by the side of a friend, and He gives facilities to all living entities according to their desires.</div>
<A NAME="58941"></A><div id="58941"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/atmavatam" class="d">&#257;tmavat&#257;m</a></span> is significant in this verse. There are three different kinds of devotees, namely <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/kanistha" class="d">kani&#7779;&#7789;ha</a>-<a href="/d/adhikari" class="d">adhik&#257;r&#299;</a>, <a href="/d/madhyama" class="d">madhyama</a>-<a href="/d/adhikari" class="d">adhik&#257;r&#299;</a></span> and <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/uttama" class="d">uttama</a>-<a href="/d/adhikari" class="d">adhik&#257;r&#299;</a>:</span> the neophyte, the preacher and the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/maha" class="d">mah&#257;</a>-<a href="/d/bhagavata" class="d">bh&#257;gavata</a>,</span> or the highly advanced devotee. The highly advanced devotee is one who knows the conclusion of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> in full knowledge; thus he becomes a devotee. Indeed, not only is he convinced himself, but he can convince others on the strength of Vedic evidence. The advanced devotee can also see all other living entities as part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, without discrimination. The <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/madhyama" class="d">madhyama</a>-<a href="/d/adhikari" class="d">adhik&#257;r&#299;</a></span> (preacher) is also well versed in the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> and can convince others also, but he discriminates between the favorable and the unfavorable. In other words, the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/madhyama" class="d">madhyama</a>-<a href="/d/adhikari" class="d">adhik&#257;r&#299;</a></span> does not care for the demoniac living entities, and the neophyte <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/kanistha" class="d">kani&#7779;&#7789;ha</a>-<a href="/d/adhikari" class="d">adhik&#257;r&#299;</a></span> does not know much about <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sastra" class="d">&#347;&#257;stra</a></span> but has full faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Kum&#257;ras, however, were <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/maha" class="d">mah&#257;</a>-bh&#257;gavatas</span> because after scrutinizingly studying the Absolute Truth, they became devotees. In other words, they were in full knowledge of the Vedic conclusion. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> it is confirmed by the Lord that there are many devotees, but a devotee who is fully conversant in the Vedic conclusion is very dear to Him. Everyone is trying to elevate himself to the highest position according to his mentality. The <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s,</span> who have a bodily concept of life, try to enjoy sense gratification to the utmost. The <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;s</span>&rsquo; idea of the highest position is merging into the effulgence of the Lord. But a devotee&rsquo;s highest position is in preaching all over the world the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the devotees are actually the representatives of the Supreme Lord, and as such they travel all over the world directly as <a href="/d/narayana" class="d">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</a> because they carry <a href="/d/narayana" class="d">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</a> within their hearts and preach His glories. The representative of <a href="/d/narayana" class="d">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</a> is as good as <a href="/d/narayana" class="d">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</a>, but he is not to conclude, like the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;s, that he has become <a href="/d/narayana" class="d">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</a>. Generally, a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sannyasi" class="d">sanny&#257;s&#299;</a></span> is addressed as <a href="/d/narayana" class="d">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</a> by the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;s. Their idea is that simply by taking <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sannyasa" class="d">sanny&#257;sa</a></span> one becomes equal to <a href="/d/narayana" class="d">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</a> or becomes <a href="/d/narayana" class="d">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</a> Himself. The <a href="/d/vaisnava" class="d">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava</a> conclusion is different, as stated by &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha <a href="/d/cakravarti" class="d">Cakravart&#299;</a> &#7788;h&#257;kura:</div>

<div class="After-Verse">According to the <a href="/d/vaisnava" class="d">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava</a> philosophy, a devotee is as good as <a href="/d/narayana" class="d">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</a> not by becoming <a href="/d/narayana" class="d">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</a> but by becoming the most confidential servant of <a href="/d/narayana" class="d">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</a>. Such great personalities act as spiritual masters for the benefit of the people in general, and as such, a spiritual master who is preaching the glories of <a href="/d/narayana" class="d">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</a> should be accepted as <a href="/d/narayana" class="d">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</a> and be given all respects due Him.</div>
