<div class="Translation">When there is a congregation of devotees, their discussions, questions and answers become conclusive to both the speaker and the audience. Thus such a meeting is beneficial for everyone&rsquo;s real happiness.</div>

<div class="First">Hearing discussions among the devotees is the only means to receive the powerful message of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For instance, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> has been well known all over the world for a very long time, especially in the Western world, but because the subject matter was not discussed by devotees, there was no effect. Not a single person in the West became <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> conscious before the <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness movement was founded. But when the same <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> was presented as it is through the disciplic succession, the effect of spiritual realization was immediately manifested.</div>
<A NAME="58985"></A><div id="58985"> </div>
<div class="Purport"><a href="/d/sanat" class="d">Sanat</a>-<a href="/d/kumara" class="d">kum&#257;ra</a>, one of the Kum&#257;ras, informed <a href="/d/prthu" class="d">P&#7771;thu</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> that his meeting with the Kum&#257;ras benefited not only <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/prthu" class="d">P&#7771;thu</a> but the Kum&#257;ras as well. When <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> questioned Lord <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> about the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> thanked <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> for giving him a chance to speak about the Supreme Lord. Therefore questions put by a saintly person to another saintly person about the Supreme Personality of Godhead or about the ultimate goal of life surcharge everything spiritually. Whoever takes advantage of such discussions is benefited both in this life and in the next.</div>
<A NAME="58986"></A><div id="58986"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/ubhayesam" class="d">ubhaye&#7779;&#257;m</a></span> can be described in many ways. Generally there are two classes of men, the materialist and the transcendentalist. By hearing discussions between devotees, both the materialist and transcendentalist are benefited. The materialist is benefited by association with devotees because his life then becomes regulated so that his chance of becoming a devotee or making the present life successful for understanding the real position of the living entity is increased. When one takes advantage of this opportunity, he is assured of a human form of life in the next birth, or he may be liberated completely and go back home, back to Godhead. The conclusion is that if one participates in a discussion of devotees, he is both materially and spiritually benefited. The speaker and the audience are both benefited, and the <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s</span> and <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;s</span> are benefited. The discussion of spiritual matters amongst devotees is beneficial for everyone, without exception. Consequently the Kum&#257;ras admitted that not only was the King benefited by such a meeting, but the Kum&#257;ras were as well.</div>
