<div class="Translation"><a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> was seated in the transcendental airplane, which was just about to start, when he remembered his poor mother, Sun&#299;ti. He thought to himself, &ldquo;How shall I go alone to the <a href="/d/vaikuntha" class="d">Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha</a> planet and leave behind my poor mother?&rdquo;</div>

<div class="First"><a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> had a feeling of obligation to his mother, Sun&#299;ti. It was Sun&#299;ti who had given him the clue which had now enabled him to be personally carried to the <a href="/d/vaikuntha" class="d">Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha</a> planet by the associates of Lord <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a>. He now remembered her and wanted to take her with him. Actually, <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s mother, Sun&#299;ti, was his <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/patha" class="d">patha</a>-pradar&#347;aka-<a href="/d/guru" class="d">guru</a>.</span> <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/patha" class="d">Patha</a>-pradar&#347;aka-<a href="/d/guru" class="d">guru</a></span> means &ldquo;the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/guru" class="d">guru</a>,</span> or the spiritual master, who shows the way.&rdquo; Such a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/guru" class="d">guru</a></span> is sometimes called <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/siksa" class="d">&#347;ik&#7779;&#257;</a>-<a href="/d/guru" class="d">guru</a>.</span> Although <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> was his <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/diksa" class="d">d&#299;k&#7779;&#257;</a>-<a href="/d/guru" class="d">guru</a></span> (initiating spiritual master), Sun&#299;ti, his mother, was the first who gave him instruction on how to achieve the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is the duty of the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/siksa" class="d">&#347;ik&#7779;&#257;</a>-<a href="/d/guru" class="d">guru</a></span> or <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/diksa" class="d">d&#299;k&#7779;&#257;</a>-<a href="/d/guru" class="d">guru</a></span> to instruct the disciple in the right way, and it depends on the disciple to execute the process. According to &#347;&#257;stric injunctions, there is no difference between <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/siksa" class="d">&#347;ik&#7779;&#257;</a>-<a href="/d/guru" class="d">guru</a></span> and <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/diksa" class="d">d&#299;k&#7779;&#257;</a>-<a href="/d/guru" class="d">guru</a>,</span> and generally the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/siksa" class="d">&#347;ik&#7779;&#257;</a>-<a href="/d/guru" class="d">guru</a></span> later on becomes the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/diksa" class="d">d&#299;k&#7779;&#257;</a>-<a href="/d/guru" class="d">guru</a>.</span> Sun&#299;ti, however, being a woman, and specifically his mother, could not become <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/diksa" class="d">d&#299;k&#7779;&#257;</a>-<a href="/d/guru" class="d">guru</a>.</span> Still, he was not less obliged to Sun&#299;ti. There was no question of carrying <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> to Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;haloka, but <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> thought of his mother.</div>
<A NAME="53993"></A><div id="53993"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Whatever plan the Supreme Personality of Godhead contemplates immediately fructifies. Similarly, a devotee who is completely dependent on the Supreme Lord can also fulfill his wishes by the grace of the Lord. The Lord fulfills His wishes independently, but a devotee fulfills his wishes simply by being dependent on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore as soon as <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> thought of his poor mother, he was assured by the associates of <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a> that Sun&#299;ti was also going to Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;haloka, in another plane. <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> had thought that he was going alone to Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;haloka, leaving behind his mother, which was not very auspicious because people would criticize him for going alone to Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;haloka and not carrying with him Sun&#299;ti, who had given him so much. But <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> also considered that he was not personally the Supreme. Therefore, if <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> fulfilled his desires, only then would it be possible. <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> could immediately understand his mind, and He told <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> that his mother was also going with him. This incident proves that a pure devotee like <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> can fulfill all his desires; by the grace of the Lord, he becomes exactly like the Lord, and thus whenever he thinks of anything, his wish is immediately fulfilled.</div>
