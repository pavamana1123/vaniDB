<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">K&#7779;atriyas</span> and <span class="Italic">vai&#347;yas</span> are therefore especially advised to give in charity at least fifty percent of their accumulated wealth. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> it is recommended that even though one enters the renounced order of life, he still cannot give up the performance of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yajna" class="d">yaj&ntilde;a</a>, <a href="/d/dana" class="d">d&#257;na</a></span> and <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/tapasya" class="d">tapasya</a>.</span> They are never to be given up. <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/tapasya" class="d">Tapasya</a></span> is meant for the renounced order of life; those who are retired from worldly activities should perform <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/tapasya" class="d">tapasya</a>,</span> penances and austerities. Those who are in the material world, the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas</span> and <span class="Italic">vai&#347;yas,</span> must give charity. <span class="Italic">Brahmac&#257;r&#299;s,</span> in the beginning of their lives, should perform different kinds of <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;as.</span></div>
<A NAME="53695"></A><div id="53695"> </div>
<div class="Purport"><a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a>, as an ideal king, practically emptied his treasury by giving charity. A king is not meant simply to realize taxes from the citizens and accumulate wealth to spend in sense gratification. World monarchy has failed ever since kings began to satisfy their personal senses with the taxes accumulated from the citizens. Of course, whether the system is monarchy or democracy, the same corruption is still going on. At the present moment there are different parties in the democratic government, but everyone is busy trying to keep his post or trying to keep his political party in power. The politicians have very little time to think of the welfare of the citizens, whom they oppress with heavy taxes in the form of income tax, sales tax and many other taxes&mdash;people sometimes have eighty to ninety percent of their income taken away, and these taxes are lavishly spent for the high salaries drawn by the officers and rulers. Formerly, the taxes accumulated from the citizens were spent for performing great sacrifices as enjoined in the Vedic literature. At the present moment, however, almost all forms of sacrifice are not at all possible; therefore, it is recommended in the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> that people should perform <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sankirtana" class="d">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</a>-<a href="/d/yajna" class="d">yaj&ntilde;a</a>.</span> Any householder, regardless of his position, can perform this <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sankirtana" class="d">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</a>-<a href="/d/yajna" class="d">yaj&ntilde;a</a></span> without expenditure. All the family members can sit down together and simply clap their hands and chant the <a href="/d/hare" class="d">Hare</a> <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/maha" class="d">mah&#257;</a>-<a href="/d/mantra" class="d">mantra</a>.</span> Somehow or other, everyone can manage to perform such a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yajna" class="d">yaj&ntilde;a</a></span> and distribute <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/prasada" class="d">pras&#257;da</a></span> to the people in general. That is quite sufficient for this age of <a href="/d/kali" class="d">Kali</a>. The <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness movement is based on this principle: chant the <a href="/d/hare" class="d">Hare</a> <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/mantra" class="d">mantra</a></span> at every moment, as much as possible, both inside and outside of the temples, and, as far as possible, distribute <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/prasada" class="d">pras&#257;da</a>.</span> This process can be accelerated with the cooperation of state administrators and those who are producing the country&rsquo;s wealth. Simply by liberal distribution of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/prasada" class="d">pras&#257;da</a></span> and <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sankirtana" class="d">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</a>,</span> the whole world can become peaceful and prosperous.</div>
<A NAME="53696"></A><div id="53696"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Generally in all the material sacrifices recommended in the Vedic literature there are offerings to the demigods. This demigod worship is especially meant for less intelligent men. Actually, the result of such sacrifice goes to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, <a href="/d/narayana" class="d">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</a>. Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/5/29?d=1">5.29</a>), <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhoktaram" class="d">bhokt&#257;ra&#7745;</a> <a href="/d/yajna" class="d">yaj&ntilde;a</a>-<a href="/d/tapasam" class="d">tapas&#257;m</a>:</span> He is actually the enjoyer of all sacrifices. His name, therefore, is <a href="/d/yajna" class="d">Yaj&ntilde;a</a>-<a href="/d/purusa" class="d">puru&#7779;a</a>.</div>
<A NAME="53697"></A><div id="53697"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Although <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> was a great devotee and had nothing to do with these sacrifices, to set an example to his people he performed many sacrifices and gave all his wealth in charity. For as long as he lived as a householder, he never spent a farthing for his sense gratification. In this verse the word <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/karma" class="d">karma</a>-<a href="/d/phala" class="d">phala</a>-<a href="/d/pradam" class="d">pradam</a></span> is very significant. The Lord awards everyone different kinds of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/karma" class="d">karma</a></span> as the individual living entities desire; He is the Supersoul present within the heart of everyone, and He is so kind and liberal that He gives everyone full facilities to perform whatever acts one wants. Then the result of the action is also enjoyed by the living entity. If anyone wants to enjoy or lord it over material nature, the Lord gives him full facilities, but he becomes entangled in the resultant reactions. Similarly, if anyone wants to engage himself fully in devotional service, the Lord gives him full facilities, and the devotee enjoys the results. The Lord is therefore known as <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/karma" class="d">karma</a>-<a href="/d/phala" class="d">phala</a>-<a href="/d/prada" class="d">prada</a>.</span></div>
