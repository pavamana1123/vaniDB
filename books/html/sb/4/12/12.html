<div class="Translation"><a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> was endowed with all godly qualities; he was very respectful to the devotees of the Supreme Lord and very kind to the poor and innocent, and he protected religious principles. With all these qualifications, he was considered to be the direct father of all the citizens.</div>

<div class="First">The personal qualities of <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> described herein are the exemplary qualities of a saintly king. Not only a king but also the leaders of a modern democratic or impersonal government must be qualified with all these godly characteristics. Then the citizens of the state can be happy. It is clearly stated here that the citizens thought of <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> as their father; as a child, depending on the able father, is completely satisfied, so the citizens of the state, being protected by the state or the king, should remain satisfied in every respect. At the present moment, however, there is no guarantee by the government of even the primary necessities of life in the state, namely, the protection of the lives and property of the citizens.</div>
<A NAME="53724"></A><div id="53724"> </div>
<div class="Purport">One word is very significant in this connection: <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmanyam" class="d">brahma&#7751;yam</a>.</span> <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> was very devoted to the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> who engage in the study of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> and thereby know the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They are always busy propagating <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness. The state should be very respectful to societies that distribute God consciousness all over the world, but, unfortunately, at the present moment there is no state or government support given to such movements. As for good qualities, it is very difficult to find anyone in state administration with any good qualities. The administrators simply sit in their administrative posts and say no to every request, as if they were paid to say no to the citizens. Another word, <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/dina" class="d">d&#299;na</a>-<a href="/d/vatsalam" class="d">vatsalam</a>,</span> is very significant also. The state head should be very kind to the innocent. Unfortunately, in this age the state agents and the presidents draw good salaries from the state, and they <a href="/d/pose" class="d">pose</a> themselves as very pious, but they allow the running of slaughterhouses, where innocent animals are killed. If we try to compare the godly qualities of <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> to the qualities of modern statesmen, we can see that there is no actual comparison. <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> was present in the <a href="/d/satya" class="d">Satya</a>-<a href="/d/yuga" class="d">yuga</a>, as will be clear from the next verses. He was the ideal king in <a href="/d/satya" class="d">Satya</a>-<a href="/d/yuga" class="d">yuga</a>. The government administration in the present age (<a href="/d/kali" class="d">Kali</a>-<a href="/d/yuga" class="d">yuga</a>) is bereft of all godly qualities. Considering all these points, the people today have no alternative but to take to <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness for protection of religion, life and property.</div>
