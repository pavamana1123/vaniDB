<div class="Translation">When <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> was attempting to get on the transcendental plane, he saw death personified approach him. Not caring for death, however, he took advantage of the opportunity to put his feet on the head of death, and thus he got up on the airplane, which was as big as a house.</div>

<div class="First">To take the passing away of a devotee and the passing away of a nondevotee as one and the same is completely misleading. While ascending the transcendental airplane, <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> suddenly saw death personified before him, but he was not afraid. Instead of death&rsquo;s giving him trouble, <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> took advantage of death&rsquo;s presence and put his feet on the head of death. People with a poor fund of knowledge do not know the difference between the death of a devotee and the death of a nondevotee. In this connection, an example can be given: a cat carries its kittens in its mouth, and it also catches a <a href="/d/rat" class="d">rat</a> in its mouth. Superficially, the catching of the <a href="/d/rat" class="d">rat</a> and the kitten appear to be one and the same, but actually they are not. When the cat catches the <a href="/d/rat" class="d">rat</a> in its mouth it means death for the <a href="/d/rat" class="d">rat</a>, whereas when the cat catches the kitten, the kitten enjoys it. When <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> boarded the airplane, he took advantage of the arrival of death personified, who came to offer him obeisances; putting his feet on the head of death, he got up on the unique airplane, which is described here to be as big as a house (<span class="Italic"><a href="/d/grham" class="d">g&#7771;ham</a></span>).</div>
<A NAME="53967"></A><div id="53967"> </div>
<div class="Purport">There are many other similar instances in <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhagavata" class="d">Bh&#257;gavata</a></span> literature. It is stated that when <a href="/d/kardama" class="d">Kardama</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> created an airplane to carry his wife, <a href="/d/devahuti" class="d">Devah&#363;ti</a>, all over the universe, the airplane was like a big city, carrying many houses, lakes and gardens. Modern scientists have manufactured big airplanes, but they are packed with passengers, who experience all sorts of discomforts while riding in them.</div>
<A NAME="53968"></A><div id="53968"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Material scientists are not even perfect in manufacturing a material airplane. In order to compare to the plane used by <a href="/d/kardama" class="d">Kardama</a> or the plane sent from Vi&#7779;&#7751;uloka, they must manufacture an airplane equipped like a big city, with all the comforts of life&mdash;lakes, gardens, parks, etc. Their plane must be able to fly in outer space and hover, and visit all other planets. If they invent such a plane, they will not have to make different space stations for fuel to travel into outer space. Such a plane would have an unlimited supply of fuel, or, like the plane from Vi&#7779;&#7751;uloka, would fly without it.</div>
