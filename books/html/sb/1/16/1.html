<div class="First">At the time of <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> Par&#299;k&#7779;it's birth, the expert astrologer-<span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> foretold some of his qualities. <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/pariksit" class="d">Par&#299;k&#7779;it</a> developed all those qualities, being a great devotee of the Lord. The real qualification is to become a devotee of the Lord, and gradually all the good qualities worthy of possession develop. <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/pariksit" class="d">Par&#299;k&#7779;it</a> was a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/maha" class="d">mah&#257;</a>-<a href="/d/bhagavata" class="d">bh&#257;gavata</a>,</span> or a first-class devotee, who was not only well versed in the science of devotion but also able to convert others to become devotees by his transcendental instructions. <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/pariksit" class="d">Par&#299;k&#7779;it</a> was, therefore, a devotee of the first order, and thus he used to consult great sages and learned <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> who could advise him by the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> how to execute the state administration. Such great kings were more responsible than modern elected executive heads because they obliged the great authorities by following their instructions left in Vedic literatures. There was no need for impractical fools to enact daily a new legislative bill and to conveniently alter it again and again to serve some purpose. The rules and regulations were already set forth by great sages like <a href="/d/manu" class="d">Manu</a>, Y&#257;j&ntilde;avalkya, <a href="/d/parasara" class="d">Par&#257;&#347;ara</a> and other liberated sages, and the enactments were all suitable for all ages in all places. Therefore the rules and regulations were standard and without flaw or defect. Kings like <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/pariksit" class="d">Par&#299;k&#7779;it</a> had their council of advisers, and all the members of that council were either great sages or <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> of the first order. They did not accept any salary, nor had they any necessity for such salaries. <span class="Italic">The state would get the best advice without expenditure.</span> They were themselves <span class="Italic">samadar&#347;&#299;,</span> equal to everyone, both man and animal. They would not advise the king to give protection to man and instruct him to kill the poor animals. Such council members were not fools or representatives to compose a fool's paradise. They were all self-realized souls, and they knew perfectly well how all living beings in the state would be happy, both in this life and in the next. They were not concerned with the hedonistic philosophy of eat, drink, be merry and enjoy. They were philosophers in the real sense, and they knew well what is the mission of human life. Under all these obligations, the advisory council of the king would give correct directions, and the king or executive head, being himself a qualified devotee of the Lord, would scrutinizingly follow them for the welfare of the state. The state in the days of <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/yudhisthira" class="d">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira</a> or <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/pariksit" class="d">Par&#299;k&#7779;it</a> was a welfare state in the real sense of the term because no one was unhappy in that state, be he man or animal. <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/pariksit" class="d">Par&#299;k&#7779;it</a> was an ideal king for a welfare state of the world.</div>
