<div class="Translation"><a href="/d/suta" class="d">S&#363;ta</a> Gosv&#257;m&#299; said: While <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/pariksit" class="d">Par&#299;k&#7779;it</a> was residing in the capital of the <a href="/d/kuru" class="d">Kuru</a> empire, the symptoms of the age of <a href="/d/kali" class="d">Kali</a> began to infiltrate within the jurisdiction of his state. When he learned about this, he did not think the matter very palatable. This did, however, give him a chance to fight. He took up his bow and arrows and prepared himself for military activities.</div>

<div class="First">The state administration of <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/pariksit" class="d">Par&#299;k&#7779;it</a> was so perfect that he was sitting in his capital peacefully. But he got the news that the symptoms of the age of <a href="/d/kali" class="d">Kali</a> had already infiltrated into the jurisdiction of his state, and he did not like this news. What are the symptoms of the age of <a href="/d/kali" class="d">Kali</a>? They are (1) illicit connection with women, (2) indulgence in meat-eating, (3) intoxication and (4) taking pleasure in gambling. The age of <a href="/d/kali" class="d">Kali</a> literally means the age of quarrel, and the abovementioned four symptoms in human society are the root causes for all kinds of quarrel. <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/pariksit" class="d">Par&#299;k&#7779;it</a> heard that some of the people of the state had already taken to those symptoms, and he wanted to take immediate steps against such causes of unrest. This means that at least up to the regime of <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/pariksit" class="d">Par&#299;k&#7779;it</a>, such symptoms of public life were practically unknown, and as soon as they were slightly detected, he wanted to root them out. The news was not palatable for him, but in a way it was, because <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/pariksit" class="d">Par&#299;k&#7779;it</a> got a chance to fight. There was no need to fight with small states because everyone was peacefully under his subordination, but the <a href="/d/kali" class="d">Kali</a>-<a href="/d/yuga" class="d">yuga</a> miscreants gave his fighting spirit a chance for exhibition. A perfect <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/ksatriya" class="d">k&#7779;atriya</a></span> king is always jubilant as soon as he gets a chance to fight, just as a sportsman is eager when there is a chance for a sporting match. It is no argument that in the age of <a href="/d/kali" class="d">Kali</a> such symptoms are predestined. If so, then why was there preparation for fighting out such symptoms? Such arguments are offered by lazy and unfortunate men. In the rainy season, rain is predestined, and yet people take precautions to protect themselves. Similarly, in the age of <a href="/d/kali" class="d">Kali</a> the symptoms as above mentioned are sure to infiltrate into social life, but it is the duty of the state to save the citizens from the association of the agents of the age of <a href="/d/kali" class="d">Kali</a>. <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/pariksit" class="d">Par&#299;k&#7779;it</a> wanted to punish the miscreants indulging in the symptoms of <a href="/d/kali" class="d">Kali</a>, and thus save the innocent citizens who were pure in habit by culture of religion. It is the duty of the king to give such protection, and <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/pariksit" class="d">Par&#299;k&#7779;it</a> was perfectly right when he prepared himself to fight.</div>
