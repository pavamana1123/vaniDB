<div class="Translation">The eighth incarnation was King &#7770;&#7779;abha, son of King <a href="/d/nabhi" class="d">N&#257;bhi</a> and his wife Merudev&#299;. In this incarnation the Lord showed the path of perfection, which is followed by those who have fully controlled their senses and who are honored by all orders of life.</div>

<div class="First">The society of human being is naturally divided into eight by orders and statuses of life-the four divisions of occupation and four divisions of cultural advancement. The intelligent class, the administrative class, the productive class and the laborer class are the four divisions of occupation. And the student life, the householder's life, retired life and renounced life are the four statuses of cultural advancement towards the path of spiritual realization. Out of these, the renounced order of life, or the order of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sannyasa" class="d">sanny&#257;sa</a>,</span> is considered the highest of all, and a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sannyasi" class="d">sanny&#257;s&#299;</a></span> is constitutionally the spiritual master for all the orders and divisions. In the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sannyasa" class="d">sanny&#257;sa</a></span> order also there are four stages of upliftment toward perfection. These stages are called <span class="Italic">ku&#7789;&#299;caka, bah&#363;daka, parivr&#257;jak&#257;c&#257;rya,</span> and <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/paramahamsa" class="d">paramaha&#7745;sa</a>.</span> The <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/paramahamsa" class="d">paramaha&#7745;sa</a></span> stage of life is the highest stage of perfection. This order of life is respected by all others. <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> &#7770;&#7779;abha, the son of King <a href="/d/nabhi" class="d">N&#257;bhi</a> and Merudev&#299;, was an incarnation of the Lord, and He instructed His sons to follow the path of perfection by <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/tapasya" class="d">tapasya</a>,</span> which sanctifies one's existence and enables one to attain the stage of spiritual happiness which is eternal and ever increasing. Every living being is searching after happiness, but no one knows where eternal and unlimited happiness is obtainable. Foolish men seek after material sense pleasure as a substitute for real happiness, but such foolish men forget that temporary so-called happiness derived from sense pleasures is also enjoyed by the dogs and hogs. No animal, bird or beast is bereft of this sense pleasure. In every species of life, including the human form of life, such happiness is immensely obtainable. The human form of life, however, is not meant for such cheap happiness. The human life is meant for attaining eternal and unlimited happiness by spiritual realization. This spiritual realization is obtained by <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/tapasya" class="d">tapasya</a>,</span> or undergoing voluntarily the path of penance and abstinence from material pleasure. Those who have been trained for abstinence in material pleasures are called <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/dhira" class="d">dh&#299;ra</a>,</span> or men undisturbed by the senses. Only these <span class="Italic">dh&#299;ras</span> can accept the orders of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sannyasa" class="d">sanny&#257;sa</a>,</span> and they can gradually rise to the status of the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/paramahamsa" class="d">paramaha&#7745;sa</a>,</span> which is adored by all members of society. King &#7770;&#7779;abha propagated this mission, and at the last stage He became completely aloof from the material bodily needs, which is a rare stage not to be imitated by foolish men, but to be worshiped by all.</div>
