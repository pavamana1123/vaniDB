<div class="First">Men with a poor fund of knowledge only accept the history of the world from the time of <a href="/d/buddha" class="d">Buddha</a>, or since 600 B.C., and prior to this period all histories mentioned in the scriptures are calculated by them to be only imaginary stories. That is not a fact. All the stories mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Pur&#257;&#7751;as</span> and <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata,</span> etc., are actual histories, not only of this planet but also of millions of other planets within the universe. Sometimes the history of planets beyond this world appear to such men to be unbelievable. But they do not know that different planets are not equal in all respects and that therefore some of the historical facts derived from other planets do not correspond with the experience of this planet. Considering the different situation of different planets and also time and circumstances, there is nothing wonderful in the stories of the <span class="Italic">Pur&#257;&#7751;as,</span> nor are they imaginary. We should always remember the maxim that one man's food is another man's poison. We should not, therefore, reject the stories and histories of the <span class="Italic">Pur&#257;&#7751;as</span> as imaginary. The great <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;is</span> like <a href="/d/vyasa" class="d">Vy&#257;sa</a> had no business putting some imaginary stories in their literatures.</div>
<A NAME="12519"></A><div id="12519"> </div>
<div class="Purport">In the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a></span> historical facts selected from the histories of different planets have been depicted. It is therefore accepted by all the spiritual authorities as the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/maha" class="d">Mah&#257;</a>-<a href="/d/purana" class="d">Pur&#257;&#7751;a</a>.</span> The special significance of these histories is that they are all connected with activities of the Lord in a different time and atmosphere. &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; is the topmost personality of all the self-realized souls, and he accepted this as the subject of studies from his father, Vy&#257;sadeva. &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva is the great authority, and the subject matter of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a></span> being so important, he delivered the message first to his great son &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;. It is compared to the cream of the milk. Vedic literature is like the milk ocean of knowledge. Cream or butter is the most palatable essence of milk, and so also is <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a>,</span> for it contains all palatable, instructive and authentic versions of different activities of the Lord and His devotees. There is no gain, however, in accepting the message of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a></span> from the unbelievers, atheists and professional reciters who make a trade of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a></span> for the laymen. It was delivered to &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, and he had nothing to do with the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhagavata" class="d">Bh&#257;gavata</a></span> business. He did not have to maintain family expenses by such trade. <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a></span> should therefore be received from the representative of &#346;ukadeva, who must be in the renounced order of life without family encumbrance. Milk is undoubtedly very good and nourishing, but when it is touched by the mouth of a snake it is no longer nourishing; rather, it becomes a source of death. Similarly, those who are not strictly in the <a href="/d/vaisnava" class="d">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava</a> discipline should not make a business of this <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a></span> and become a cause of spiritual death for so many hearers. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> the Lord says that the purpose of all the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> is to know Him (Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>), and <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a></span> is Lord &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> Himself in the form of recorded knowledge. Therefore, it is the cream of all the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> and it contains all historical facts of all times in relation with &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. It is factually the essence of all histories.</div>
