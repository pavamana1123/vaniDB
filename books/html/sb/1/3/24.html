<div class="Translation">Then, in the beginning of <a href="/d/kali" class="d">Kali</a>-<a href="/d/yuga" class="d">yuga</a>, the Lord will appear as Lord <a href="/d/buddha" class="d">Buddha</a>, the son of <a href="/d/anjana" class="d">A&ntilde;jana</a>, in the province of <a href="/d/gaya" class="d">Gay&#257;</a>, just for the purpose of deluding those who are envious of the faithful theist.</div>

<div class="First">Lord <a href="/d/buddha" class="d">Buddha</a>, a powerful incarnation of the Personality of Godhead, appeared in the province of <a href="/d/gaya" class="d">Gay&#257;</a> (Bihar) as the son of <a href="/d/anjana" class="d">A&ntilde;jana</a>, and he preached his own conception of nonviolence and deprecated even the animal sacrifices sanctioned in the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> At the time when Lord <a href="/d/buddha" class="d">Buddha</a> appeared, the people in general were atheistic and preferred animal flesh to anything else. On the plea of Vedic sacrifice, every place was practically turned into a slaughterhouse, and animal killing was indulged in unrestrictedly. Lord <a href="/d/buddha" class="d">Buddha</a> preached nonviolence, taking pity on the poor animals. He preached that he did not believe in the tenets of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> and stressed the adverse psychological effects incurred by animal killing. Less intelligent men of the age of <a href="/d/kali" class="d">Kali</a>, who had no faith in God, followed his principle, and for the time being they were trained in moral discipline and nonviolence, the preliminary steps for proceeding further on the path of God realization. He deluded the atheists because such atheists who followed his principles did not believe in God, but they kept their absolute faith in Lord <a href="/d/buddha" class="d">Buddha</a>, who himself was the incarnation of God. Thus the faithless people were made to believe in God in the form of Lord <a href="/d/buddha" class="d">Buddha</a>. That was the mercy of Lord <a href="/d/buddha" class="d">Buddha</a>: he made the faithless faithful to him.</div>
<A NAME="12268"></A><div id="12268"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Killing of animals before the advent of Lord <a href="/d/buddha" class="d">Buddha</a> was the most prominent feature of the society. People claimed that these were Vedic sacrifices. When the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> are not accepted through the authoritative disciplic succession, the casual readers of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> are misled by the flowery language of that system of knowledge. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> a comment has been made on such foolish scholars (<span class="Italic"><a href="/d/avipascitah" class="d">avipa&#347;cita&#7717;</a></span>). The foolish scholars of Vedic literature who do not care to receive the transcendental message through the transcendental realized sources of disciplic succession are sure to be bewildered. To them, the ritualistic ceremonies are considered to be all in all. They have no depth of knowledge. According to the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span></B> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/15/15?d=1">15.15</a>), <span class="Italic">vedai&#347; <a href="/d/ca" class="d">ca</a> sarvair <a href="/d/aham" class="d">aham</a> <a href="/d/eva" class="d">eva</a> <a href="/d/vedyah" class="d">vedya&#7717;</a>:</span> the whole system of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> is to lead one gradually to the path of the Supreme Lord. The whole theme of Vedic literature is to know the Supreme Lord, the individual soul, the cosmic situation and the relation between all these items. When the relation is known, the relative function begins, and as a result of such a function the ultimate goal of life or going back to Godhead takes place in the easiest manner. Unfortunately, unauthorized scholars of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> become captivated by the purificatory ceremonies only, and natural progress is thereby checked.</div>
<A NAME="12269"></A><div id="12269"> </div>
<div class="Purport">To such bewildered persons of atheistic propensity, Lord <a href="/d/buddha" class="d">Buddha</a> is the emblem of theism. He therefore first of all wanted to check the habit of animal killing. The animal killers are dangerous elements on the path going back to Godhead. There are two types of animal killers. The soul is also sometimes called the "animal" or the living being. Therefore, both the slaughterer of animals and those who have lost their identity of soul are animal killers.</div>
<A NAME="12270"></A><div id="12270"> </div>
<div class="Purport"><a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/pariksit" class="d">Par&#299;k&#7779;it</a> said that only the animal killer cannot relish the transcendental message of the Supreme Lord. Therefore if people are to be educated to the path of Godhead, they must be taught first and foremost to <span class="Italic">stop the process of animal killing</span> as above mentioned. <span class="Italic">It is nonsensical to say that animal killing has nothing to do with spiritual realization.</span> By this dangerous theory many so-called <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;s</span> have sprung up by the grace of <a href="/d/kali" class="d">Kali</a>-<a href="/d/yuga" class="d">yuga</a> who preach animal killing under the garb of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> The subject matter has already been discussed in the conversation between Lord <a href="/d/caitanya" class="d">Caitanya</a> and Maulana Chand Kazi Shaheb. The animal sacrifice as stated in the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> is different from the unrestricted animal killing in the slaughterhouse. Because the <span class="Italic">asuras</span> or the so-called scholars of Vedic literatures put forward the evidence of animal killing in the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> Lord <a href="/d/buddha" class="d">Buddha</a> superficially denied the authority of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> This rejection of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> by Lord <a href="/d/buddha" class="d">Buddha</a> was adopted in order to save people from the vice of animal killing as well as to save the poor animals from the slaughtering process of their big brothers who clamor for universal brotherhood, peace, justice and equity. There is no justice when there is animal killing. Lord <a href="/d/buddha" class="d">Buddha</a> wanted to stop it completely, and therefore his cult of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/ahimsa" class="d">ahi&#7745;s&#257;</a></span> was propagated not only in India but also outside the country.</div>
<A NAME="12271"></A><div id="12271"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Technically Lord Buddha's philosophy is called atheistic because there is no acceptance of the Supreme Lord and because that system of philosophy denied the authority of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> But that is an act of camouflage by the Lord. Lord <a href="/d/buddha" class="d">Buddha</a> is the incarnation of Godhead. As such, he is the original propounder of Vedic knowledge. He therefore cannot reject Vedic philosophy. But he rejected it outwardly because the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sura" class="d">sura</a>-dvi&#7779;a,</span> or the demons who are always envious of the devotees of Godhead, try to support cow killing or animal killing from the pages of the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> and this is now being done by the modernized <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;s.</span> Lord <a href="/d/buddha" class="d">Buddha</a> had to reject the authority of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> altogether. This is simply technical, and had it not been so he would not have been so accepted as the incarnation of Godhead. Nor would he have been worshiped in the transcendental songs of the poet <a href="/d/jayadeva" class="d">Jayadeva</a>, who is a <a href="/d/vaisnava" class="d">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava</a> <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/acarya" class="d">&#257;c&#257;rya</a>.</span> Lord <a href="/d/buddha" class="d">Buddha</a> preached the preliminary principles of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> in a manner suitable for the time being (and so also did &#346;a&#7749;kar&#257;c&#257;rya) to establish the authority of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> Therefore both Lord <a href="/d/buddha" class="d">Buddha</a> and &#256;c&#257;rya &#346;a&#7749;kara paved the path of theism, and <a href="/d/vaisnava" class="d">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava</a> <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas,</span> specifically Lord &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/caitanya" class="d">Caitanya</a> <a href="/d/mahaprabhu" class="d">Mah&#257;prabhu</a>, led the people on the path towards a realization of going back to Godhead.</div>
<A NAME="12272"></A><div id="12272"> </div>
<div class="Purport">We are glad that people are taking interest in the nonviolent movement of Lord <a href="/d/buddha" class="d">Buddha</a>. But will they take the matter very seriously and close the animal slaughterhouses altogether? If not, there is no meaning to the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/ahimsa" class="d">ahi&#7745;s&#257;</a></span> cult.</div>
<A NAME="12273"></A><div id="12273"> </div>
<div class="Purport"><I>&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a></I> was composed just prior to the beginning of the age of <a href="/d/kali" class="d">Kali</a> (about five thousand years ago), and Lord <a href="/d/buddha" class="d">Buddha</a> appeared about twenty-six hundred years ago. Therefore in the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a></span> Lord <a href="/d/buddha" class="d">Buddha</a> is foretold. Such is the authority of this clear scripture. There are many such prophecies, and they are being fulfilled one after another. They will indicate the positive standing of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a>,</span> which is without <span class="Italic">trace of mistake, illusion, cheating and imperfection,</span> which are the four flaws of all conditioned souls. The liberated souls are above these flaws; therefore they can see and foretell things which are to take place on distant future dates.</div>
