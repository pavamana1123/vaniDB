<div class="Translation">King <a href="/d/yudhisthira" class="d">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira</a>, who was much aggrieved, could not be convinced, despite instructions by great sages headed by <a href="/d/vyasa" class="d">Vy&#257;sa</a> and the Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> Himself, the performer of superhuman feats, and despite all historical evidence.</div>

<div class="First">The pious King <a href="/d/yudhisthira" class="d">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira</a> was mortified because of the mass massacre of human beings in the Battle of <a href="/d/kuruksetra" class="d">Kuruk&#7779;etra</a>, especially on his account. Duryodhana was there on the throne, and he was doing well in his administration, and in one sense there was no need of fighting. But on the principle of justice <a href="/d/yudhisthira" class="d">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira</a> was to replace him. The whole clique of politics centered around this point, and all the kings and residents of the whole world became involved in this fight between the rival brothers. Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> was also there on the side of King <a href="/d/yudhisthira" class="d">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira</a>. It is said in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata, &#256;di-<a href="/d/parva" class="d">parva</a></span></B> (20) that 640,000,000 men were killed in the eighteen days of the Battle of <a href="/d/kuruksetra" class="d">Kuruk&#7779;etra</a>, and some hundreds of thousands were missing. Practically this was the greatest battle in the world within five thousand years.</div>
<A NAME="15639"></A><div id="15639"> </div>
<div class="Purport">This mass killing simply to enthrone <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/yudhisthira" class="d">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira</a> was too mortifying, so he tried to be convinced with evidences from histories by great sages like <a href="/d/vyasa" class="d">Vy&#257;sa</a> and the Lord Himself that the fight was just because the cause was just. But <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/yudhisthira" class="d">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira</a> would not be satisfied, even though he was instructed by the greatest personalities of the time. <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is designated herein as the performer of superhuman actions, but in this particular instance neither He nor <a href="/d/vyasa" class="d">Vy&#257;sa</a> could convince King <a href="/d/yudhisthira" class="d">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira</a>. Does it mean that He failed to be a superhuman actor? No, certainly not. The interpretation is that the Lord as <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/isvara" class="d">&#299;&#347;vara</a>,</span> or the Supersoul in the hearts of both King <a href="/d/yudhisthira" class="d">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira</a> and <a href="/d/vyasa" class="d">Vy&#257;sa</a>, performed still more superhuman action because the Lord desired it. As Supersoul of King <a href="/d/yudhisthira" class="d">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira</a>, He did not allow the King to be convinced by the words of <a href="/d/vyasa" class="d">Vy&#257;sa</a> and others, including Himself, because He desired that the King hear instructions from the dying Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva, who was another great devotee of the Lord. The Lord wanted that at the last stage of his material existence the great warrior Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva see Him personally and see his beloved grandchildren, King <a href="/d/yudhisthira" class="d">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira</a>, etc., now situated on the throne, and thus pass away very peacefully. Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva was not at all satisfied to fight against the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas, who were his beloved fatherless grandchildren. But the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas</span> are also very stern people, and therefore he was obliged to take the side of Duryodhana because he was maintained at the expense of Duryodhana. Besides this, the Lord also desired that King <a href="/d/yudhisthira" class="d">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira</a> be pacified by the words of Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva so that the world could see that Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva excelled all in knowledge, including the Lord Himself.</div>
