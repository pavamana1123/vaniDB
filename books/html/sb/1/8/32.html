<div class="Translation">Some say that the Unborn is born for the glorification of pious kings, and others say that He is born to please King <a href="/d/yadu" class="d">Yadu</a>, one of Your dearest devotees. You appear in his family as sandalwood appears in the <a href="/d/malaya" class="d">Malaya</a> hills.</div>

<div class="First">Because the Lord's appearance in this material world is bewildering, there are different opinions about the birth of the Unborn. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> the Lord says that He takes His birth in the material world, although He is the Lord of all creations and He is unborn. So there cannot be any denial of the birth of the Unborn because He Himself establishes the truth. But still there are different opinions as to why He takes His birth. That is also declared in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a>.</span> He appears by His own internal potency to reestablish the principles of religion and to protect the pious and to annihilate the impious. That is the mission of the appearance of the Unborn. Still, it is said that the Lord is there to glorify the pious King <a href="/d/yudhisthira" class="d">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira</a>. Lord &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> certainly wanted to establish the kingdom of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas for the good of all in the world. When there is a pious king ruling over the world, the people are happy. When the ruler is impious, the people are unhappy. In the age of <a href="/d/kali" class="d">Kali</a> in most cases the rulers are impious, and therefore the citizens are also continuously unhappy. But in the case of democracy, the impious citizens themselves elect their representative to rule over them, and therefore they cannot blame anyone for their unhappiness. <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/nala" class="d">Nala</a> was also celebrated as a great pious king, but he had no connection with Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. Therefore <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/yudhisthira" class="d">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira</a> is meant here to be glorified by Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. He had also glorified King <a href="/d/yadu" class="d">Yadu</a>, having taken His birth in the family. He is known as <a href="/d/yadava" class="d">Y&#257;dava</a>, Yaduv&#299;ra, <a href="/d/yadunandana" class="d">Yadunandana</a>, etc., although the Lord is always independent of such obligation. He is just like the sandalwood that grows in the <a href="/d/malaya" class="d">Malaya</a> hills. Trees can grow anywhere and everywhere, yet because the sandalwood trees grow mostly in the area of the <a href="/d/malaya" class="d">Malaya</a> hills, the name sandalwood and the <a href="/d/malaya" class="d">Malaya</a> hills are interrelated. Therefore, the conclusion is that the Lord is ever unborn like the sun, and yet He appears as the sun rises on the eastern horizon. As the sun is never the sun of the eastern horizon, so the Lord is no one's son, but He is the father of everything that be.</div>
