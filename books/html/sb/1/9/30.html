<div class="Translation">Thereupon that man who spoke on different subjects with thousands of meanings and who fought on thousands of battlefields and protected thousands of men, stopped speaking and, being completely freed from all bondage, withdrew his mind from everything else and fixed his wide-open eyes upon the original Personality of Godhead, &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, who stood before him, four-handed, dressed in yellow garments that glittered and shined.</div>

<A NAME="16174"></A><div id="16174"> </div>
<div class="First">In the momentous hour of leaving his material body, Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva set the glorious example concerning the important function of the human form of life. <span class="Italic">The subject matter which attracts the dying man becomes the beginning of his next life.</span> Therefore, if one is absorbed in thoughts of the Supreme Lord &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, he is sure to go back to Godhead without any doubt. This is confirmed in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span></B> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/8/5?d=1">8.5</a>-15):</div>
<A NAME="16175"></A><div id="16175"> </div>
<div class="Purport">5: And whoever, at the time of death, quits his body remembering Me alone, at once attains My nature. Of this there is no doubt.</div>
<A NAME="16176"></A><div id="16176"> </div>
<div class="Purport">6:<B> </B>Whatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, that state he will attain without fail.</div>
<A NAME="16177"></A><div id="16177"> </div>
<div class="Purport">7: Therefore, <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a>, you should always think of Me in the form of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> and at the same time carry out your prescribed duty of fighting. With your activities dedicated to Me and your mind and intelligence fixed on Me, you will attain Me without doubt.</div>
<A NAME="16178"></A><div id="16178"> </div>
<div class="Purport">8:<B> </B>He who meditates on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his mind constantly engaged in remembering Me, undeviated from the path, he, O <a href="/d/partha" class="d">P&#257;rtha</a> [<a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a>], is sure to reach Me.</div>
<A NAME="16179"></A><div id="16179"> </div>
<div class="Purport">9: One should meditate upon the Supreme Person as the one who knows everything, as He who is the oldest, who is the controller, who is smaller than the smallest, who is the maintainer of everything, who is beyond all material conception, who is inconceivable, and who is always a person. He is luminous like the sun and, being transcendental, is beyond this material nature.</div>
<A NAME="16180"></A><div id="16180"> </div>
<div class="Purport">10: One who, at the time of death, fixes his life air between the eyebrows and in full devotion engages himself in remembering the Supreme Lord will certainly attain to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<A NAME="16181"></A><div id="16181"> </div>
<div class="Purport">11: Persons learned in the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> who utter <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/omkara" class="d">o&#7745;k&#257;ra</a></span> and who are great sages in the renounced order, enter into <a href="/d/brahman" class="d">Brahman</a>. Desiring such perfection, one practices celibacy. I shall now explain to you this process by which one may attain salvation.</div>
<A NAME="16182"></A><div id="16182"> </div>
<div class="Purport">12: The yogic situation is that of detachment from all sensual engagements. Closing all the doors of the senses and fixing the mind on the heart and the life air at the top of the head, one establishes himself in <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a>.</span></div>
<A NAME="16183"></A><div id="16183"> </div>
<div class="Purport">13: After being situated in this <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> practice and vibrating the sacred syllable <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/om" class="d">o&#7745;</a>,</span> the supreme combination of letters, if one thinks of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and quits his body, he will certainly reach the spiritual planets.</div>
<A NAME="16184"></A><div id="16184"> </div>
<div class="Purport">14: For one who remembers Me without deviation, I am easy to obtain, O son of <a href="/d/prtha" class="d">P&#7771;th&#257;</a>, because of his constant engagement in devotional service.</div>
<A NAME="16185"></A><div id="16185"> </div>
<div class="Purport">15: After attaining Me, the great souls, who are <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> in devotion, never return to this temporary world, which is full of miseries, because they have attained the highest perfection.</div>
<A NAME="16186"></A><div id="16186"> </div>
<div class="Purport">&#346;r&#299; Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva attained the perfection of quitting his body at will and was fortunate enough to have Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, the object of his attention, personally present at the time of death. He therefore fixed his open eyes upon Him. He wanted to see &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> for a long time out of his spontaneous love for Him. Because he was a pure devotee, he had very little to do with the detailed performance of yogic principles. Simple <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">bhakti</a>-<a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> is enough to bring about perfection. Therefore, the ardent desire of Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva was to see the <span class="Italic">person</span> of Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, the most lovable object, and by the grace of the Lord, &#346;r&#299; Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva had this opportunity at the last stage of his breathing.</div>
