<div class="First">The Battle of <a href="/d/kuruksetra" class="d">Kuruk&#7779;etra</a> was fought on military principles but at the same time in a sporting spirit, like a friend's fight with another friend. Duryodhana criticized Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva, alleging that he was reluctant to kill <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> because of paternal affection. A <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/ksatriya" class="d">k&#7779;atriya</a></span> cannot tolerate insults on the principle of fighting. Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva therefore promised that the next day he would kill all five P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas with special weapons made for the purpose. Duryodhana was satisfied, and he kept the arrows with him to be delivered the next day during the fight. By tricks <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> took the arrows from Duryodhana, and Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva could understand that this was the trick of Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. So he took a vow that the next day <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> would have to take up weapons Himself, otherwise His friend <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> would die. In the next day's fighting Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva fought so violently that both <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> and <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> were in trouble. <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> was almost defeated; the situation was so tense that he was about to be killed by Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva the very next moment. At that time Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> wanted to please His devotee, <a href="/d/bhisma" class="d">Bh&#299;&#7779;ma</a>, by keeping Bh&#299;&#7779;ma's promise, which was more important than His own. Seemingly He broke His own promise. He promised before the beginning of the Battle of <a href="/d/kuruksetra" class="d">Kuruk&#7779;etra</a> that He would remain without weapons and would not use His strength for either of the parties. But to protect <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> He got down from the chariot, took up the wheel of the chariot and hurriedly rushed at Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva in an angry mood, as a lion goes to kill an elephant. He dropped His covering cloth on the way, and out of great anger He did not know that He had dropped it. Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva at once gave up his weapons and stood to be killed by <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, his beloved Lord. The fighting of the day was thus ended at that very moment, and <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> was saved. Of course there was no possibility of Arjuna's death because the Lord Himself was on the chariot, but because Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva wanted to see Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> take up some weapon to save His friend, the Lord created this situation, making Arjuna's death imminent. He stood before Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva to show him that his promise was fulfilled and that He had taken up the wheel.</div>
