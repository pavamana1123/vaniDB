<div class="First">The Lord descends from His abode (K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;aloka), the topmost planet in the spiritual sky, in order to help the demigod administrators of this material world when they are greatly vexed by the <span class="Italic">asuras,</span> who are envious not only of the Lord but also of His devotees. As referred to above, the conditioned living beings contact material association by their own choice, dictated by a strong desire to lord it over the resources of the material world and become imitation lords of all they survey. Everyone is trying to become an imitation God; there is keen competition amongst such imitation gods, and such competitors are generally known as <span class="Italic">asuras.</span> When there are too many <span class="Italic">asuras</span> in the world, then it becomes a hell for those who are devotees of the Lord. Due to the growth of the <span class="Italic">asuras,</span> the mass of people who are generally devoted to the Lord by nature and the pure devotees of the Lord, including the demigods in higher planets, pray to the Lord for relief, and the Lord either descends personally from His abode or deputes some of His devotees to remodel the fallen condition of human society, or even animal society. Such disruptions take place not only in human society but also among animals, birds or other living beings, including the demigods in the higher planets. Lord &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> descended personally to vanquish <span class="Italic">asuras</span> like <a href="/d/kamsa" class="d">Ka&#7745;sa</a>, <a href="/d/jarasandha" class="d">Jar&#257;sandha</a> and &#346;i&#347;up&#257;la, and during the reign of <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/yudhisthira" class="d">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira</a> almost all these <span class="Italic">asuras</span> were killed by the Lord. Now he was awaiting the annihilation of His own dynasty, called the <a href="/d/yadu" class="d">Yadu</a>-<a href="/d/vamsa" class="d">va&#7745;&#347;a</a>, who appeared by His will in this world. He wanted to take them away before His own departure to His eternal abode. <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a>, like <a href="/d/vidura" class="d">Vidura</a>, did not disclose the imminent annihilation of the <a href="/d/yadu" class="d">Yadu</a> dynasty, but indirectly gave a hint to the King and his brothers to wait till the incident happened and the Lord departed.</div>
