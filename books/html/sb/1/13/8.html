<div class="First">Due to P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;u's death at an early age, his minor children and widow were the object of special care by all the elderly members of the family, especially Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva and <a href="/d/mahatma" class="d">Mah&#257;tm&#257;</a> <a href="/d/vidura" class="d">Vidura</a>. <a href="/d/vidura" class="d">Vidura</a> was more or less partial to the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas due to their political position. Although <a href="/d/dhrtarastra" class="d">Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra</a> was equally careful for the minor children of <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/pandu" class="d">P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;u</a>, he was one of the intriguing parties who wanted to wash away the descendants of <a href="/d/pandu" class="d">P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;u</a> and replace them by raising his own sons to become the rulers of the kingdom. <a href="/d/mahatma" class="d">Mah&#257;tm&#257;</a> <a href="/d/vidura" class="d">Vidura</a> could follow this intrigue of <a href="/d/dhrtarastra" class="d">Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra</a> and company, and therefore, even though he was a faithful servitor of his eldest brother, <a href="/d/dhrtarastra" class="d">Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra</a>, he did not like his political ambition for the sake of his own sons. He was therefore very careful about the protection of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas and their widow mother. Thus he was, so to speak, partial to the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas, preferring them to the sons of <a href="/d/dhrtarastra" class="d">Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra</a>, although both of them were equally affectionate in his ordinary eyes. He was equally affectionate to both the camps of nephews in the sense that he always chastised Duryodhana for his intriguing policy against his cousins. He always criticized his elder brother for his policy of encouragement to his sons, and at the same time he was always alert in giving special protection to the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas. All these different activities of <a href="/d/vidura" class="d">Vidura</a> within the palace politics made him well-known as partial to the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas. <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/yudhisthira" class="d">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira</a> has referred to the past history of <a href="/d/vidura" class="d">Vidura</a> before his going away from home for a prolonged pilgrim's journey. <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/yudhisthira" class="d">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira</a> reminded him that he was equally kind and partial to his grown-up nephews, even after the Battle of <a href="/d/kuruksetra" class="d">Kuruk&#7779;etra</a>, a great family disaster.</div>
<A NAME="18174"></A><div id="18174"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Before the Battle of <a href="/d/kuruksetra" class="d">Kuruk&#7779;etra</a>, Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra's policy was peaceful annihilation of his nephews, and therefore he ordered Purocana to build a house at V&#257;ra&#7751;&#257;vata, and when the building was finished <a href="/d/dhrtarastra" class="d">Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra</a> desired that his brother's family live there for some time. When the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas were going there in the presence of all the members of the royal family, <a href="/d/vidura" class="d">Vidura</a> tactfully gave instructions to the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas about the future plan of <a href="/d/dhrtarastra" class="d">Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra</a>. This is specifically described in the <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic"></B>&#256;di-<a href="/d/parva" class="d">parva</a></span></B> 114). He indirectly hinted, "A weapon not made of steel or any other material element can be more than sharp to kill an enemy, and he who knows this is never killed." That is to say, he hinted that the party of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas was being sent to V&#257;ra&#7751;&#257;vata to be killed, and thus he warned <a href="/d/yudhisthira" class="d">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira</a> to be very careful in their new residential palace. He also gave indications of fire and said that fire cannot extinguish the soul but can annihilate the material body. But one who protects the soul can live. <a href="/d/kunti" class="d">Kunt&#299;</a> could not follow such indirect conversations between <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/yudhisthira" class="d">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira</a> and <a href="/d/vidura" class="d">Vidura</a>, and thus when she inquired from her son about the purport of the conversation, <a href="/d/yudhisthira" class="d">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira</a> replied that from the talks of <a href="/d/vidura" class="d">Vidura</a> it was understood that there was a hint of fire in the house where they were proceeding. Later on, <a href="/d/vidura" class="d">Vidura</a> came in disguise to the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas and informed them that the housekeeper was going to set fire to the house on the fourteenth night of the waning moon. It was an intrigue of <a href="/d/dhrtarastra" class="d">Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra</a> that the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas might die all together with their mother. And by his warning the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas escaped through a tunnel underneath the earth so that their escape was also unknown to <a href="/d/dhrtarastra" class="d">Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra</a>, so much so that after setting the fire, the Kauravas were so certain of the death of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas that <a href="/d/dhrtarastra" class="d">Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra</a> performed the last rites of death with great cheerfulness. And during the mourning period all the members of the palace became overwhelmed with lamentation, but <a href="/d/vidura" class="d">Vidura</a> did not become so, because of his knowledge that the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas were alive somewhere. There are many such instances of calamities, and in each of them <a href="/d/vidura" class="d">Vidura</a> gave protection to the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas on one hand, and on the other he tried to restrain his brother <a href="/d/dhrtarastra" class="d">Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra</a> from such intriguing policies. Therefore, he was always partial to the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas, just as a bird protects its eggs by its wing.</div>
