<div class="Translation">O twice-born sages, by serving those devotees who are completely freed from all vice, great service is done. By such service, one gains affinity for hearing the messages of <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">V&#257;sudeva</a>.</div>
<A NAME="11650"></A><div id="11650"> </div>

<div class="First">The conditioned life of a living being is caused by his revolting against the Lord. There are men called <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/deva" class="d">deva</a>,</span> or godly living beings, and there are men called <span class="Italic">asuras,</span> or demons, who are against the authority of the Supreme Lord. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> (Sixteenth Chapter) a vivid description of the <span class="Italic">asuras</span> is given in which it is said that the <span class="Italic">asuras</span> are put into lower and lower states of ignorance life after life and so sink to the lower animal forms and have no information of the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead. These <span class="Italic">asuras</span> are gradually rectified to God consciousness by the mercy of the Lord's liberated servitors in different countries according to the supreme will. Such devotees of God are very confidential associates of the Lord, and when they come to save human society from the dangers of godlessness, they are known as the powerful incarnations of the Lord, as sons of the Lord, as servants of the Lord or as associates of the Lord. But none of them falsely claim to be God themselves. This is a blasphemy declared by the <span class="Italic">asuras,</span> and the demoniac followers of such <span class="Italic">asuras</span> also accept pretenders as God or His incarnation. In the revealed scriptures there is definite information of the incarnation of God. No one should be accepted as God or an incarnation of God unless he is confirmed by the revealed scriptures.</div>
<A NAME="11652"></A><div id="11652"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The servants of God are to be respected as God by the devotees who actually want to go back to Godhead. Such servants of God are called <span class="Italic">mah&#257;tm&#257;s,</span> or <span class="Italic">t&#299;rthas,</span> and they preach according to particular time and place. The servants of God urge people to become devotees of the Lord. They never tolerate being called God. &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/caitanya" class="d">Caitanya</a> <a href="/d/mahaprabhu" class="d">Mah&#257;prabhu</a> was God Himself according to the indication of the revealed scriptures, but He played the part of a devotee. People who knew Him to be God addressed Him as God, but He used to block His ears with His hands and chant the name of Lord <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a>. He strongly protested against being called God, although undoubtedly He was God Himself. The Lord behaves so to warn us against unscrupulous men who take pleasure in being addressed as God.</div>
<A NAME="11653"></A><div id="11653"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The servants of God come to propagate God consciousness, and intelligent people should cooperate with them in every respect. By serving the servant of God, one can please God more than by directly serving the Lord. The Lord is more pleased when He sees that His servants are properly respected because such servants risk everything for the service of the Lord and so are very dear to the Lord. The Lord declares in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span></B> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/18/69?d=1">18.69</a>) that no one is dearer to Him than one who risks everything to preach His glory. By serving the servants of the Lord, one gradually gets the quality of such servants, and thus one becomes qualified to hear the glories of God. The eagerness to hear about God is the first qualification of a devotee eligible for entering the kingdom of God.</div>
