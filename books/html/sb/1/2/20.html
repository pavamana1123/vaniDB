<div class="First">In the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span></B> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/7/3?d=1">7.3</a>) it is said that out of many thousands of ordinary men, one fortunate man endeavors for perfection in life. Mostly men are conducted by the modes of passion and ignorance, and thus they are engaged always in lust, desire, hankerings, ignorance and sleep. Out of many such manlike animals, there is actually a man who knows the responsibility of human life and thus tries to make life perfect by following the prescribed duties. And out of many thousands of such persons who have thus attained success in human life, one may know scientifically about the Personality of Godhead &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. In the same <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span></B> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/18/55?d=1">18.55</a>) it is also said that scientific knowledge of &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is understood only by the process of devotional service (<span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">bhakti</a>-<a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a>).</span></div>
<A NAME="11716"></A><div id="11716"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The very same thing is confirmed herein in the above words. No ordinary man, or even one who has attained success in human life, can know scientifically or perfectly the Personality of Godhead. Perfection of human life is attained when one can understand that he is not the product of matter but is in fact spirit. And as soon as one understands that he has nothing to do with matter, he at once ceases his material hankerings and becomes enlivened as a spiritual being. This attainment of success is possible when one is above the modes of passion and ignorance, or, in other words, when one is actually a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> by qualification. A <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> is the symbol of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sattva" class="d">sattva</a>-<a href="/d/guna" class="d">gu&#7751;a</a>,</span> or the mode of goodness. And others, who are not in the mode of goodness, are either <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas, vai&#347;yas, &#347;&#363;dras</span> or less than the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras.</span> The brahminical stage is the highest stage of human life because of its good qualities. So one cannot be a devotee unless one at least qualifies as a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a>.</span> The devotee is already a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> by action. But that is not the end of it. As referred to above, such a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> has to become a <a href="/d/vaisnava" class="d">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava</a> in fact to be actually in the transcendental stage. A pure <a href="/d/vaisnava" class="d">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava</a> is a liberated soul and is transcendental even to the position of a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a>.</span> In the material stage even a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> is also a conditioned soul because although in the brahminical stage the conception of <a href="/d/brahman" class="d">Brahman</a> or transcendence is realized, scientific knowledge of the Supreme Lord is lacking. One has to surpass the brahminical stage and reach the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">vasudeva</a></span> stage to understand the Personality of Godhead <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. The science of the Personality of Godhead is the subject matter for study by the postgraduate students in the spiritual line. Foolish men, or men with a poor fund of knowledge, do not understand the Supreme Lord, and they interpret <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> according to their respective whims. The fact is, however, that one cannot understand the science of the Personality of Godhead unless one is freed from the contamination of the material modes, even up to the stage of a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a>.</span> When a qualified <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> factually becomes a <a href="/d/vaisnava" class="d">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava</a>, in the enlivened state of liberation he can know what is actually the Personality of Godhead.</div>
