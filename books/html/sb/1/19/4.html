<div class="Translation">While the King was thus repenting, he received news of his imminent death, which would be due to the bite of a snake-bird, occasioned by the curse spoken by the sage's son. The King accepted this as good news, for it would be the cause of his indifference toward worldly things.</div>

<div class="First">Real happiness is achieved by spiritual existence or by cessation of the repetition of birth and death. One can stop the repetition of birth and death only by going back to Godhead. In the material world, even by attaining the topmost planet (Brahmaloka), one cannot get rid of the conditions of repeated birth and death, but still we do not accept the path of attaining perfection. The path of perfection frees one from all material attachments, and thus one becomes fit to enter into the spiritual kingdom. Therefore, those who are materially poverty-stricken are better candidates than those who are materially prosperous. <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/pariksit" class="d">Par&#299;k&#7779;it</a> was a great devotee of the Lord and a bona fide candidate for entering into the kingdom of God, but even though he was so, his material assets as the Emperor of the world were setbacks to perfect attainment of his rightful status as one of the associates of the Lord in the spiritual sky. As a devotee of the Lord, he could understand that the cursing of the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> boy, although unwise, was a blessing upon him, being the cause of detachment from worldly affairs, both political and social. &#346;am&#299;ka <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> also, after regretting the incident, conveyed the news to the King as a matter of duty so that the King would be able to prepare himself to go back to Godhead. &#346;am&#299;ka <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> sent news to the King that foolish &#346;&#7771;&#7749;gi, his son, although a powerful <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> boy, unfortunately had misused his spiritual power by cursing the King unwarrantedly. The incident of the King's garlanding the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/muni" class="d">muni</a></span> was not sufficient cause for being cursed to death, but since there was no way to retract the curse, the King was informed to prepare for death within a week. Both &#346;am&#299;ka <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> and the King were self-realized souls. &#346;am&#299;ka <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> was a mystic, and <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/pariksit" class="d">Par&#299;k&#7779;it</a> was a devotee. Therefore there was no difference between them in self-realization. Neither of them was afraid of meeting death. <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/pariksit" class="d">Par&#299;k&#7779;it</a> could have gone to the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/muni" class="d">muni</a></span> to beg his pardon, but the news of imminent death was conveyed to the King with so much regret by the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/muni" class="d">muni</a></span> that the King did not want to shame the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/muni" class="d">muni</a></span> further by his presence there. He decided to prepare himself for his imminent death and find out the way to go back to Godhead.</div>
<A NAME="22076"></A><div id="22076"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The life of a human being is a chance to prepare oneself to go back to Godhead, or to get rid of the material existence, the repetition of birth and death. Thus in the system of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/varnasrama" class="d">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama</a>-<a href="/d/dharma" class="d">dharma</a></span> every man and woman is trained for this purpose. In other words, the system of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/varnasrama" class="d">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama</a>-<a href="/d/dharma" class="d">dharma</a></span> is known also as <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sanatana" class="d">san&#257;tana</a>-<a href="/d/dharma" class="d">dharma</a>,</span> or the eternal occupation. The system of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/varnasrama" class="d">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama</a>-<a href="/d/dharma" class="d">dharma</a></span> prepares a man for going back to Godhead, and thus a householder is ordered to go to the forest as <span class="Italic">v&#257;naprastha</span> to acquire complete knowledge and then to take <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sannyasa" class="d">sanny&#257;sa</a></span> prior to his inevitable death. <a href="/d/pariksit" class="d">Par&#299;k&#7779;it</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> was fortunate to get a seven-day notice to meet his inevitable death. But for the common man there is no definite notice, although death is inevitable for all. Foolish men forget this sure fact of death and neglect the duty of preparing themselves for going back to Godhead. They spoil their lives in animal propensities to eat, drink, be merry and enjoy. Such an irresponsible life is adopted by the people in the age of <a href="/d/kali" class="d">Kali</a> because of a sinful desire to condemn brahminical culture, God consciousness and cow protection, for which the state is responsible. The state must employ revenue to advance these three items and thus educate the populace to prepare for death. The state which does so is the real welfare state. The state of India should better follow the examples of <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/pariksit" class="d">Par&#299;k&#7779;it</a>, the ideal executive head, than to imitate other materialistic states which have no idea of the kingdom of Godhead, the ultimate goal of human life. Deterioration of the ideals of Indian civilization has brought about the deterioration of civic life, not only in India but also abroad.</div>
