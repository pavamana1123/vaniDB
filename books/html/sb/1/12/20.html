<div class="First">A king becomes famous by his acts of charity, performances of <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;as,</span> protection of the surrendered, etc. A <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/ksatriya" class="d">k&#7779;atriya</a></span> king is proud to give protection to the surrendered souls. This attitude of a king is called <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/isvara" class="d">&#299;&#347;vara</a>-<a href="/d/bhava" class="d">bhava</a>,</span> or factual power to give protection in a righteous cause. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> the Lord instructs living beings to surrender unto Him, and He promises all protection. The Lord is all-powerful and true to His word, and therefore He never fails to give protection to His different devotees. The king, being the representative of the Lord, must possess this attitude of giving protection to the surrendered souls at all risk. <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> &#346;ibi, the King of <a href="/d/usinara" class="d">U&#347;&#299;nara</a>, was an intimate friend of <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> Yay&#257;ti, who was able to reach the heavenly planets along with <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> &#346;ibi. <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> &#346;ibi was aware of the heavenly planet where he was to be transferred after his death, and the description of this heavenly planet is given in the <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic"></B>&#256;di-<a href="/d/parva" class="d">parva</a></span></B> 96.6-9). <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> &#346;ibi was so charitably disposed that he wanted to give over his acquired position in the heavenly kingdom to Yay&#257;ti, but he did not accept it. Yay&#257;ti went to the heavenly planet along with great <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;is</span> like <a href="/d/astaka" class="d">A&#7779;&#7789;aka</a> and others. On inquiry from the <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;is,</span> Yay&#257;ti gave an account of &#346;ibi's pious acts when all of them were on the path to heaven. He has become a member of the assembly of Yamar&#257;ja, who has become his worshipful deity. As confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a>,</span> the worshiper of the demigods goes to the planets of the demigods (<span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yanti" class="d">y&#257;nti</a> <a href="/d/deva" class="d">deva</a>-<a href="/d/vrata" class="d">vrat&#257;</a> <a href="/d/devan" class="d">dev&#257;n</a> </I>[</I>Bg</I>. </I><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/9/25?d=1">9.25</a></I>]</span></I>); so <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> &#346;ibi has become an associate of the great <a href="/d/vaisnava" class="d">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava</a> authority Yamar&#257;ja on that particular planet. While he was on the earth he became very famous as a protector of surrendered souls and a donor of charities. The King of heaven once took the shape of a pigeon-hunter bird (eagle), and <a href="/d/agni" class="d">Agni</a>, the fire-god, took the shape of a pigeon. The pigeon, while being chased by the eagle, took shelter on the lap of <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> &#346;ibi, and the hunter eagle wanted the pigeon back from the King. The King wanted to give it some other meat to eat and requested the bird not to kill the pigeon. The hunter bird refused to accept the King's offer, but it was settled later on that the eagle would accept flesh from the body of the King of the pigeon's equivalent weight. The King began to cut flesh from his body to weigh in the balance equivalent to the weight of the pigeon, but the mystic pigeon always remained heavier. The King then put himself on the balance to equate with the pigeon, and the demigods were pleased with him. The King of heaven and the fire-god disclosed their identity, and the King was blessed by them. <a href="/d/devarsi" class="d">Devar&#7779;i</a> <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> also glorified <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> &#346;ibi for his great achievements, specifically in charity and protection. <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> &#346;ibi sacrificed his own son for the satisfaction of human beings in his kingdom. And thus child <a href="/d/pariksit" class="d">Par&#299;k&#7779;it</a> was to become a second &#346;ibi in charity and protection.</div>

<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">Dau&#7779;yanti <a href="/d/bharata" class="d">Bharata</a>:</span> There are many Bharatas in history, of which <a href="/d/bharata" class="d">Bharata</a> the brother of Lord <a href="/d/rama" class="d">R&#257;ma</a>, <a href="/d/bharata" class="d">Bharata</a> the son of King &#7770;&#7779;abha, and <a href="/d/bharata" class="d">Bharata</a> the son of <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> Du&#7779;yanta are very famous. And all these Bharatas are historically known to the universe. This earth planet is known as <a href="/d/bharata" class="d">Bh&#257;rata</a>, or <a href="/d/bharata" class="d">Bh&#257;rata</a>-<a href="/d/varsa" class="d">var&#7779;a</a>, due to King <a href="/d/bharata" class="d">Bharata</a> the son of &#7770;&#7779;abha, but according to some this land is known as <a href="/d/bharata" class="d">Bh&#257;rata</a> due to the reign of the son of Du&#7779;yanta. So far as we are convinced, this land's name <a href="/d/bharata" class="d">Bh&#257;rata</a>-<a href="/d/varsa" class="d">var&#7779;a</a> was established from the reign of <a href="/d/bharata" class="d">Bharata</a> the son of King &#7770;&#7779;abha. Before him the land was known as Il&#257;vati-<a href="/d/varsa" class="d">var&#7779;a</a>, but just after the coronation of <a href="/d/bharata" class="d">Bharata</a>, the son of &#7770;&#7779;abha, this land became famous as <a href="/d/bharata" class="d">Bh&#257;rata</a>-<a href="/d/varsa" class="d">var&#7779;a</a>.</div>
<A NAME="17816"></A><div id="17816"> </div>
<div class="Purport">But despite all this, <a href="/d/bharata" class="d">Bharata</a>, the son of <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> Du&#7779;yanta was not less important. He is the son of the famous beauty &#346;akuntal&#257;. <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> Du&#7779;yanta fell in love with &#346;akuntal&#257; in the forest, and <a href="/d/bharata" class="d">Bharata</a> was conceived. After that, <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> forgot his wife &#346;akuntal&#257; by the curse of <a href="/d/kanva" class="d">Ka&#7751;va</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a>, and the child <a href="/d/bharata" class="d">Bharata</a> was brought up in the forest by his mother. Even in his childhood he was so powerful that he challenged the lions and elephants in the forest and would fight with them as little children play with cats and dogs. Because of the boy's becoming so strong, more than the so-called modern Tarzan, the <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;is</span> in the forest called him Sarvadaman, or one who is able to control everyone. A full description of <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/bharata" class="d">Bharata</a> is given in the <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata, &#256;di-<a href="/d/parva" class="d">parva</a>.</span> The P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas, or the Kurus, are sometimes addressed as <a href="/d/bharata" class="d">Bh&#257;rata</a> due to being born in the dynasty of the famous <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/bharata" class="d">Bharata</a>, the son of King Du&#7779;yanta.</div>
