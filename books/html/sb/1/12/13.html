Learned br&#257;hma&#7751;as, headed by <a href="/d/dhaumya" class="d">Dhaumya</a> and <a href="/d/krpa" class="d">K&#7771;pa</a>, recited auspicious hymns.</div>

<div class="First">There is a need for a good and intelligent class of <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> who are expert in performing the purificatory processes prescribed in the system of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/varnasrama" class="d">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama</a>-<a href="/d/dharma" class="d">dharma</a>.</span> Unless such purificatory processes are performed, there is no possibility of good population, and in the age of <a href="/d/kali" class="d">Kali</a> the population all over the world is of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sudra" class="d">&#347;&#363;dra</a></span> quality or lower for want of this purificatory process. It is not possible, however, to revive the Vedic process of purification in this age, for want of proper facilities and good <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> but there is the <span class="Italic">P&#257;&ntilde;car&#257;trika</span> system also recommended for this age. The <span class="Italic">P&#257;&ntilde;car&#257;trika</span> system acts on the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sudra" class="d">&#347;&#363;dra</a></span> class of men, supposedly the population of the <a href="/d/kali" class="d">Kali</a>-<a href="/d/yuga" class="d">yuga</a>, and it is the prescribed purificatory process suitable to the age and time. Such a purificatory process is allowed only for spiritual upliftment and not for any other purpose. Spiritual upliftment is never conditioned by higher or lower parentage.</div>
<A NAME="17709"></A><div id="17709"> </div>
<div class="Purport">After the <span class="Italic">garbh&#257;dh&#257;na</span> purificatory process, there are certain other <span class="Italic">sa&#7745;sk&#257;ras</span> like <span class="Italic">s&#299;mantonnayana, sadhabhak&#7779;a&#7751;am,</span> etc., during the period of pregnancy, and when the child is born the first purificatory process is <span class="Italic">j&#257;takarman.</span> This was performed duly by <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/yudhisthira" class="d">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira</a> with the help of good and learned <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> like <a href="/d/dhaumya" class="d">Dhaumya</a>, the royal priest, and K&#7771;p&#257;c&#257;rya, who was not only a priest but also a great general. Both these learned and perfect priests, assisted by other good <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> were employed by <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/yudhisthira" class="d">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira</a> to perform the ceremony. Therefore all the <span class="Italic">sa&#7745;sk&#257;ras,</span> purificatory processes, are not mere formalities or social functions only, but they are all for practical purposes and can be successfully performed by expert <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> like <a href="/d/dhaumya" class="d">Dhaumya</a> and <a href="/d/krpa" class="d">K&#7771;pa</a>. Such <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> are not only rare, but also not available in this age, and therefore, for the purpose of spiritual upliftment in this fallen age, the Gosv&#257;m&#299;s prefer the purificatory processes under <span class="Italic">P&#257;&ntilde;car&#257;trika</span> formulas to the Vedic rites.</div>
<A NAME="17710"></A><div id="17710"> </div>
<div class="Purport">K&#7771;p&#257;c&#257;rya is the son of the great &#7770;&#7779;i Sardban and was born in the family of <a href="/d/gautama" class="d">Gautama</a>. The birth is said to be accidental. By chance, the great &#7770;&#7779;i Sardban met Janapad&#299;, a famous society girl of heaven, and the &#7770;&#7779;i Sardban discharged semina in two parts. By one part immediately a male child and by the other part a female child were born as twins. The male child was later on known as <a href="/d/krpa" class="d">K&#7771;pa</a>, and the female child was known as <a href="/d/krpi" class="d">K&#7771;p&#299;</a>. <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> &#346;antanu, while engaged in chase in the jungle, picked up the children and brought them up to the brahminical status by the proper purificatory process. K&#7771;p&#257;c&#257;rya later became a great general like Dro&#7751;&#257;c&#257;rya, and his sister was married to Dro&#7751;&#257;c&#257;rya. K&#7771;p&#257;c&#257;rya later on took part in the Battle of <a href="/d/kuruksetra" class="d">Kuruk&#7779;etra</a> and joined the party of Duryodhana. K&#7771;p&#257;c&#257;rya helped kill <a href="/d/abhimanyu" class="d">Abhimanyu</a>, the father of <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/pariksit" class="d">Par&#299;k&#7779;it</a>, but he was still held in esteem by the family of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas due to his being as great a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> as Dro&#7751;&#257;c&#257;rya. When the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas were sent to the forest after being defeated in the gambling <a href="/d/game" class="d">game</a> with Duryodhana, <a href="/d/dhrtarastra" class="d">Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra</a> entrusted the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas to K&#7771;p&#257;c&#257;rya for guidance. After the end of the battle, K&#7771;p&#257;c&#257;rya again became a member of the royal assembly, and he was called during the birth of <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/pariksit" class="d">Par&#299;k&#7779;it</a> for recitation of auspicious Vedic hymns to make the ceremony successful. <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/yudhisthira" class="d">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira</a>, while quitting the palace for his great departure to the Himalayas, entrusted K&#7771;p&#257;c&#257;rya with <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/pariksit" class="d">Par&#299;k&#7779;it</a> as his disciple, and he left home satisfied because of K&#7771;p&#257;c&#257;rya's taking charge of <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/pariksit" class="d">Par&#299;k&#7779;it</a>. The great administrators, kings and emperors were always under the guidance of learned <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> like K&#7771;p&#257;c&#257;rya and thus were able to act properly in the discharge of political responsibilities.</div>
