<div class="First"><span class="Italic"><a href="/d/praja" class="d">Praj&#257;</a></span> means the living being who has taken his birth in the material world. Actually the living being has no birth and no death, but because of his separation from the service of the Lord and due to his desire to lord it over material nature, he is offered a suitable body to satisfy his material desires. In doing so, one becomes conditioned by the laws of material nature, <span class="Italic">and the material body is changed in terms of his own work.</span> The living entity thus transmigrates from one body to another in 8,400,000 species of life. But due to his being the part and parcel of the Lord, he not only is maintained with all necessaries of life by the Lord, but also is protected by the Lord and His representatives, the saintly kings. These saintly kings give protection to all the <span class="Italic">praj&#257;s,</span> or living beings, to live and to fulfill their terms of imprisonment. <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/pariksit" class="d">Par&#299;k&#7779;it</a> was actually an ideal saintly king because while touring his kingdom he happened to see that a poor cow was about to be killed by the personified <a href="/d/kali" class="d">Kali</a>, whom he at once took to task as a murderer. This means that even the animals were given protection by the saintly administrators, not from any sentimental point of view, but because those who have taken their birth in the material world have the right to live. All the saintly kings, beginning from the King of the sun globe down to the King of the earth, are so inclined by the influence of the Vedic literatures. The Vedic literatures are taught in higher planets also, as there is reference in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span></B> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/4/1?d=1">4.1</a>) about the teachings to the sun-god (<a href="/d/vivasvan" class="d">Vivasv&#257;n</a>) by the Lord, and such lessons are transferred by disciplic succession, as it was done by the sun-god to his son <a href="/d/manu" class="d">Manu</a>, and from <a href="/d/manu" class="d">Manu</a> to <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/iksvaku" class="d">Ik&#7779;v&#257;ku</a>. There are fourteen Manus in one day of <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a>, and the <a href="/d/manu" class="d">Manu</a> referred to herein is the seventh <a href="/d/manu" class="d">Manu</a>, who is one of the <span class="Italic">praj&#257;patis</span> (those who create progeny), and he is the son of the sun-god. He is known as the <a href="/d/vaivasvata" class="d">Vaivasvata</a> <a href="/d/manu" class="d">Manu</a>. He had ten sons, and <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/iksvaku" class="d">Ik&#7779;v&#257;ku</a> is one of them. <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/iksvaku" class="d">Ik&#7779;v&#257;ku</a> also learned <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">bhakti</a>-<a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> as taught in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> from his father, <a href="/d/manu" class="d">Manu</a>, who got it from his father, the sun-god. Later on the teaching of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> came down by disciplic succession from <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/iksvaku" class="d">Ik&#7779;v&#257;ku</a>, but in course of time the chain was broken by unscrupulous persons, and therefore it again had to be taught to <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> on the Battlefield of <a href="/d/kuruksetra" class="d">Kuruk&#7779;etra</a>. So all the Vedic literatures are current from the very beginning of creation of the material world, and thus the Vedic literatures are known as <span class="Italic">apauru&#7779;eya</span> (not made by man). The Vedic knowledge was spoken by the Lord and first heard by <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a>, the first created living being within the universe.</div>

Lord <a href="/d/rama" class="d">R&#257;ma</a> descended along with His plenary portions, and all of them appeared as His younger brothers.

When He was just a young boy, He helped the great sage <a href="/d/visvamitra" class="d">Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra</a> by killing Subahu and striking <a href="/d/marica" class="d">M&#257;r&#299;ca</a>, the she-demon, who was disturbing the sages in their daily discharge of duties.

He rewarded the administrative demigods by effective weapons to conquer the demons through the agency of <a href="/d/visvamitra" class="d">Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra</a>. He was present in the bow sacrifice of King <a href="/d/janaka" class="d">Janaka</a>, and by breaking the invincible bow of &#346;iva, He married S&#299;t&#257;dev&#299;, daughter of <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/janaka" class="d">Janaka</a>.</div>

He instructed His brother &#346;atrughna to attack Lav&#7751;&#257;sura, who reigned at <a href="/d/mathura" class="d">Mathur&#257;</a>, and the demon was killed. He performed ten <a href="/d/asvamedha" class="d">A&#347;vamedha</a> sacrifices, and later on He disappeared while taking a bath in the &#346;arayu River. The great epic <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/ramayana" class="d">R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</a></span> is the history of Lord R&#257;ma's activities in the world, and the authoritative <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/ramayana" class="d">R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</a></span> was written by the great poet V&#257;lm&#299;ki.</div>
