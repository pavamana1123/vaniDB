Once the impression of the transcendental form of the Lord is fixed in one's mind, one can never forget Him in any circumstance. Child <a href="/d/pariksit" class="d">Par&#299;k&#7779;it</a>, after coming out of the womb, was in the habit of examining everyone to see whether he was the same personality whom he first saw in the womb. But no one could be equal to or more attractive than the Lord, and therefore he never accepted anyone. But the Lord was constantly with him by such examination, and thus <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/pariksit" class="d">Par&#299;k&#7779;it</a> was always engaged in the devotional service of the Lord by remembrance.</div>

<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;la <a href="/d/jiva" class="d">J&#299;va</a> Gosv&#257;m&#299; remarks in this connection that every child, if given an impression of the Lord from his very childhood, certainly becomes a great devotee of the Lord like <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/pariksit" class="d">Par&#299;k&#7779;it</a>.</span> One may not be as fortunate as <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/pariksit" class="d">Par&#299;k&#7779;it</a> to have the opportunity to see the Lord in the womb of his mother, but even if he is not so fortunate, he can be made so if the parents of the child desire him to be so. There is a practical example in my personal life in this connection. My father was a pure devotee of the Lord, and when I was only four or five years old, my father gave me a couple of forms of <a href="/d/radha" class="d">R&#257;dh&#257;</a> and <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. In a playful manner, I used to worship these Deities along with my sister, and I used to imitate the performances of a neighboring temple of <a href="/d/radha" class="d">R&#257;dh&#257;</a>-<a href="/d/govinda" class="d">Govinda</a>. By constantly visiting this neighboring temple and copying the ceremonies in connection with my own Deities of play, I developed a natural affinity for the Lord. My father used to observe all the ceremonies befitting my position. Later on, these activities were suspended due to my association in the schools and colleges, and I became completely out of practice. But in my youthful days, when I met my spiritual master, &#346;r&#299; &#346;r&#299;mad Bhaktisiddh&#257;nta <a href="/d/sarasvati" class="d">Sarasvat&#299;</a> Gosv&#257;m&#299; <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a>, again I revived my old habit, and the same playful Deities became my worshipful Deities in proper regulation. This was followed up until I left the family connection, and I am pleased that my generous father gave the first impression which was developed later into regulative devotional service by His Divine Grace. <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/prahlada" class="d">Prahl&#257;da</a> also advised that such impressions of a godly relation must be impregnated from the beginning of childhood, otherwise one may miss the opportunity of the human form of life, which is very valuable although it is temporary like others.</div>
