<div class="First">Mental equanimity refers both to <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/yudhisthira" class="d">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira</a> and to <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a>, the grandfather of all living beings. According to &#346;r&#299;dhara <a href="/d/svami" class="d">Sv&#257;m&#299;</a>, the grandfather referred to is <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a>, but according to Vi&#347;van&#257;tha <a href="/d/cakravarti" class="d">Cakravart&#299;</a>, the grandfather is <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/yudhisthira" class="d">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira</a> himself. But in both cases the comparison is equally good because both of them are recognized representatives of the Supreme Lord, and thus both of them have to maintain mental equanimity, being engaged in welfare work for the living being. Any responsible executive agent at the top of administration has to tolerate different types of onslaughts from the very persons for whom he works. Brahm&#257;j&#299; was criticized even by the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s,</span> the highest perfectional devotees of the Lord. The <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> were dissatisfied with the work of Brahm&#257;j&#299; because Lord <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a>, as creator of this particular universe, created eyelids which obstructed their seeing Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. They could not tolerate a moment's blinking of the eyes, for it kept them from seeing their beloved Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. So what to speak of others, who are naturally very critical of every action of a responsible man? Similarly, <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/yudhisthira" class="d">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira</a> had to cross over many difficult situations created by his enemies, and he proved to be the most perfect maintainer of mental equanimity in all critical circumstances. Therefore the example of both grandfathers for maintaining equanimity of mind is quite fitting.</div>
<A NAME="17866"></A><div id="17866"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Lord &#346;iva is a celebrated demigod who awards gifts to beggars. His name is therefore &#256;&#347;uto&#7779;a, or one who is pleased very easily. He is also called the Bh&#363;tan&#257;tha, or the lord of the common folk, who are mainly attached to him because of his munificent gifts, even without consideration of the aftereffects. <a href="/d/ravana" class="d">R&#257;va&#7751;a</a> was very attached to Lord &#346;iva, and by easily pleasing him, <a href="/d/ravana" class="d">R&#257;va&#7751;a</a> became so powerful that he wanted to challenge the authority of Lord <a href="/d/rama" class="d">R&#257;ma</a>. Of course, <a href="/d/ravana" class="d">R&#257;va&#7751;a</a> was never helped by Lord &#346;iva when he fought with <a href="/d/rama" class="d">R&#257;ma</a>, the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the Lord of Lord &#346;iva. To V&#7771;k&#257;sura, Lord &#346;iva awarded a benediction which was not only awkward, but also disturbing. V&#7771;k&#257;sura became empowered, by the grace of Lord &#346;iva, to vanish anyone's head simply by touching it. Although this was awarded by Lord &#346;iva, the cunning fellow wanted to make an experiment of the power by touching the head of Lord &#346;iva. Thus the lord had to take shelter of <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a> to save himself from trouble, and the Lord <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a>, by His illusory potency, asked V&#7771;k&#257;sura to make an experiment with his own head. The fellow did it and was finished himself, and so the world was saved from all sorts of trouble by such a cunning beggar of the demigods. The excellent point is that Lord &#346;iva never denies anyone any sort of gift. He is therefore the most generous, although sometimes some kind of a mistake is made.</div>
<A NAME="17867"></A><div id="17867"> </div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic"><a href="/d/rama" class="d">Ram&#257;</a></span> means the goddess of fortune. And her shelter is Lord <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a>. Lord <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a> is the maintainer of all living beings. There are innumerable living beings, not only on the surface of this planet but also in all other hundreds of thousands of planets. All of them are provided with all necessities of life for the progressive march towards the end of self-realization, but on the path of sense gratification they are put into difficulty by the agency of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/maya" class="d">m&#257;y&#257;</a>,</span> the illusory energy, and so travel the path of a false plan of economic development. Such economic development is never successful because it is illusory. These men are always after the mercy of the illusory goddess of fortune, but they do not know that the goddess of fortune can live only under the protection of <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a>. Without <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a>, the goddess of fortune is an illusion. We should therefore seek the protection of <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a> instead of directly seeking the protection of the goddess of fortune. Only <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a> and the devotees of <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a> can give protection to all, and because <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/pariksit" class="d">Par&#299;k&#7779;it</a> was himself protected by <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a>, it was quite possible for him to give complete protection to all who wanted to live under his rule.</div>
