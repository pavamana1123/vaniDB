<div class="Translation">Your respectable younger brother, who possesses the strength of ten thousand elephants, killed, by His grace, <a href="/d/jarasandha" class="d">Jar&#257;sandha</a>, whose feet were worshiped by many kings. These kings had been brought for sacrifice in Jar&#257;sandha's Mah&#257;bhairava-<a href="/d/yajna" class="d">yaj&ntilde;a</a>, but they were thus released. Later they paid tribute to Your Majesty.</div>

<div class="First"><a href="/d/jarasandha" class="d">Jar&#257;sandha</a> was a very powerful king of <a href="/d/magadha" class="d">Magadha</a>, and the history of his birth and activities is also very interesting. His father, King <a href="/d/brhadratha" class="d">B&#7771;hadratha</a>, was also a very prosperous and powerful King of <a href="/d/magadha" class="d">Magadha</a>, but he had no son, although he married two daughters of the King of <a href="/d/kasi" class="d">K&#257;&#347;&#299;</a>. Being disappointed in not getting a son from either of the two queens, the King, along with his wives, left home to live in the forest for austerities, but in the forest he was blessed by one great <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/rsi" class="d">&#7771;&#7779;i</a></span> to have a son, and he gave him one mango to be eaten by the queens. The queens did so and were very soon pregnant. The King was very happy to see the queens bearing children, but when the ripe time approached, the queens delivered one child in two parts, one from each of the queens' wombs. The two parts were thrown in the forest, where a great she-demon used to live, and she was glad to have some delicate flesh and blood from the newly born child. Out of curiosity she joined the two parts, and the child became complete and regained life. The she-demon was known as <a href="/d/jara" class="d">Jar&#257;</a>, and being compassionate on the childless King, she went to the King and presented him with the nice child, The King was very pleased with the she-demon and wanted to reward her according to her desire. The she-demon expressed her desire that the child be named after her, and thus the child was surnamed <a href="/d/jarasandha" class="d">Jar&#257;sandha</a>, or one who was joined by <a href="/d/jara" class="d">Jar&#257;</a>, the she-demon. In fact, this <a href="/d/jarasandha" class="d">Jar&#257;sandha</a> was born as one of the parts and parcels of the demon Vipracitti. The saint by whose benedictions the queens bore the child was called <a href="/d/candra" class="d">Candra</a> <a href="/d/kausika" class="d">Kau&#347;ika</a>, who foretold of the child before his father <a href="/d/brhadratha" class="d">B&#7771;hadratha</a>.</div>

<div class="Purport">Since he possessed demoniac qualities from birth, naturally he became a great devotee of Lord &#346;iva, who is the lord of all ghostly and demoniac men. <a href="/d/ravana" class="d">R&#257;va&#7751;a</a> was a great devotee of Lord &#346;iva, and so also King <a href="/d/jarasandha" class="d">Jar&#257;sandha</a>. He used to sacrifice all arrested kings before Lord Mah&#257;bhairava (&#346;iva) and by his military power he defeated many small kings and arrested them to butcher before Mah&#257;bhairava. There are many devotees of Lord Mah&#257;bhairava, or K&#257;labhairava, in the province of Bihar, formerly called <a href="/d/magadha" class="d">Magadha</a>. <a href="/d/jarasandha" class="d">Jar&#257;sandha</a> was a relative of <a href="/d/kamsa" class="d">Ka&#7745;sa</a>, the maternal uncle of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, and therefore after Ka&#7745;sa's death King <a href="/d/jarasandha" class="d">Jar&#257;sandha</a> became a great enemy of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, and there were many fights between <a href="/d/jarasandha" class="d">Jar&#257;sandha</a> and <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> wanted to kill him, but He also wanted that those who served as military men for <a href="/d/jarasandha" class="d">Jar&#257;sandha</a> might not be killed. Therefore a plan was adopted to kill him. <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, <a href="/d/bhima" class="d">Bh&#299;ma</a> and <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> together went to <a href="/d/jarasandha" class="d">Jar&#257;sandha</a> in the dress of poor <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and begged charity from King <a href="/d/jarasandha" class="d">Jar&#257;sandha</a>. <a href="/d/jarasandha" class="d">Jar&#257;sandha</a> never refused charity to any <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a>,</span> and he performed many sacrifices also, yet he was not on a par with devotional service. Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, <a href="/d/bhima" class="d">Bh&#299;ma</a> and <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> asked <a href="/d/jarasandha" class="d">Jar&#257;sandha</a> for the facility of fighting him, and it was settled that <a href="/d/jarasandha" class="d">Jar&#257;sandha</a> would fight with <a href="/d/bhima" class="d">Bh&#299;ma</a> only. So all of them were both guests and combatants of <a href="/d/jarasandha" class="d">Jar&#257;sandha</a>, and <a href="/d/bhima" class="d">Bh&#299;ma</a> and <a href="/d/jarasandha" class="d">Jar&#257;sandha</a> fought every day for several days. <a href="/d/bhima" class="d">Bh&#299;ma</a> became disappointed, but <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> gave him hints about Jar&#257;sandha's being joined together as an infant, and thus <a href="/d/bhima" class="d">Bh&#299;ma</a> dissected him again and so killed him. All the kings who were detained in the concentration camp to be killed before Mah&#257;bhairava were thus released by <a href="/d/bhima" class="d">Bh&#299;ma</a>. Feeling thus obliged to the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas, they paid tribute to King <a href="/d/yudhisthira" class="d">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira</a>.</div>
