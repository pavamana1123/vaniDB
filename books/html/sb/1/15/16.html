The demon father employed all his weapons to kill the devotee son, <a href="/d/prahlada" class="d">Prahl&#257;da</a>, but by the grace of the Lord he was saved from all sorts of dangerous actions by his father. He was thrown in a fire, in boiling oil, from the top of a hill, underneath the legs of an elephant, and he was administered poison. At last the father himself took up a chopper to kill his son, and thus N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva appeared and killed the heinous father in the presence of the son. Thus no one can kill the devotee of the Lord. Similarly, <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> was also saved by the Lord, although all dangerous weapons were employed by his great opponents like <a href="/d/bhisma" class="d">Bh&#299;&#7779;ma</a>.</div>

<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic"><a href="/d/karna" class="d">Kar&#7751;a</a>:</span> Born of <a href="/d/kunti" class="d">Kunt&#299;</a> by the sun-god prior to her marriage with <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/pandu" class="d">P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;u</a>, <a href="/d/karna" class="d">Kar&#7751;a</a> took his birth with bangles and earrings, extraordinary signs for an undaunted hero. In the beginning his name was Vasusena, but when he grew up he presented his natural bangles and earrings to Indradeva, and thenceforward he became known as Vaikartana. After his birth from the maiden <a href="/d/kunti" class="d">Kunt&#299;</a>, he was thrown in the Ganges. Later he was picked up by <a href="/d/adhiratha" class="d">Adhiratha</a>, and he and his wife <a href="/d/radha" class="d">R&#257;dh&#257;</a> brought him up as their own offspring. <a href="/d/karna" class="d">Kar&#7751;a</a> was very charitable, especially toward the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as.</span> There was nothing he could not spare for a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a>.</span> In the same charitable spirit he gave in charity his natural bangles and earrings to Indradeva, who, being very much satisfied with him, gave him in return a great weapon called &#346;akti. He was admitted as one of the students of Dro&#7751;&#257;c&#257;rya, and from the very beginning there was some rivalry between him and <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a>. Seeing his constant rivalry with <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a>, Duryodhana picked him up as his companion, and this gradually grew into greater intimacy. He was also present in the great assembly of Draupad&#299;'s <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/svayamvara" class="d">svaya&#7745;vara</a></span> function, and when he attempted to exhibit his talent in that meeting, Draupad&#299;'s brother declared that <a href="/d/karna" class="d">Kar&#7751;a</a> could not take part in the competition because of his being the son of a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sudra" class="d">&#347;&#363;dra</a></span> carpenter. Although he was refused in the competition, still when <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> was successful in piercing the fish target on the ceiling and <a href="/d/draupadi" class="d">Draupad&#299;</a> bestowed her garland upon <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a>, <a href="/d/karna" class="d">Kar&#7751;a</a> and the other disappointed princes offered an unusual stumbling block to <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> while he was leaving with <a href="/d/draupadi" class="d">Draupad&#299;</a>. Specifically, <a href="/d/karna" class="d">Kar&#7751;a</a> fought with him very valiantly, but all of them were defeated by <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a>. Duryodhana was very much pleased with <a href="/d/karna" class="d">Kar&#7751;a</a> because of his constant rivalry with <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a>, and when he was in power he enthroned <a href="/d/karna" class="d">Kar&#7751;a</a> in the state of <a href="/d/anga" class="d">A&#7749;ga</a>. Being baffled in his attempt to win <a href="/d/draupadi" class="d">Draupad&#299;</a>, <a href="/d/karna" class="d">Kar&#7751;a</a> advised Duryodhana to attack King <a href="/d/drupada" class="d">Drupada</a>, for after defeating him both <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> and <a href="/d/draupadi" class="d">Draupad&#299;</a> could be arrested. But Dro&#7751;&#257;c&#257;rya rebuked them for this conspiracy, and they refrained from the action. <a href="/d/karna" class="d">Kar&#7751;a</a> was defeated many times, not only by <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> but also by <a href="/d/bhimasena" class="d">Bh&#299;masena</a>. He was the king of the kingdom of Bengal, Orissa and Madras combined. Later on he took an active part in the <a href="/d/rajasuya" class="d">R&#257;jas&#363;ya</a> sacrifice of <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/yudhisthira" class="d">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira</a>, and when there was gambling between the rival brothers, designed by &#346;akuni, <a href="/d/karna" class="d">Kar&#7751;a</a> took part in the <a href="/d/game" class="d">game</a>, and he was very pleased when <a href="/d/draupadi" class="d">Draupad&#299;</a> was offered as a bet in the gambling. This fed his old grudge. When <a href="/d/draupadi" class="d">Draupad&#299;</a> was in the <a href="/d/game" class="d">game</a> he was very enthusiastic to declare the news, and it is he who ordered <a href="/d/duhsasana" class="d">Du&#7717;&#347;&#257;sana</a> to take away the garments of both the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas and <a href="/d/draupadi" class="d">Draupad&#299;</a>. He asked <a href="/d/draupadi" class="d">Draupad&#299;</a> to select another husband because, being lost by the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas, she was rendered a slave of the Kurus. He was always an enemy of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas, and whenever there was an opportunity, he tried to curb them by all means. During the Battle of <a href="/d/kuruksetra" class="d">Kuruk&#7779;etra</a>, he foresaw the conclusive result, and he expressed his opinion that due to Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's being the chariot driver of <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a>, the battle should be won by <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a>. He always differed with <a href="/d/bhisma" class="d">Bh&#299;&#7779;ma</a>, and sometimes he was proud enough to say that within five days he could finish up the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas, if <a href="/d/bhisma" class="d">Bh&#299;&#7779;ma</a> would not interfere with his plan of action. But he was much mortified when <a href="/d/bhisma" class="d">Bh&#299;&#7779;ma</a> died. He killed Gha&#7789;otkaca with the &#346;akti weapon obtained from Indradeva. His son, Brisasena, was killed by <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a>. He killed the largest number of <a href="/d/pandava" class="d">P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;ava</a> soldiers. At last there was a severe fight with <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a>, and it was he only who was able to knock off the helmet of <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a>. But it so happened that the wheel of his chariot stuck in the battlefield mud, and when he got down to set the wheel right, <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> took the opportunity and killed him, although he requested <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> not to do so.</div>

Both the brothers and the father attended the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/svayamvara" class="d">svaya&#7745;vara</a></span> ceremony of <a href="/d/draupadi" class="d">Draupad&#299;</a>. All of them appreciated the wonderful strength of <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> due to his being the devotee friend of the Lord, and thus Bh&#363;ri&#347;rav&#257; advised the sons of <a href="/d/dhrtarastra" class="d">Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra</a> not to pick any quarrel or fight with them.

Later on, <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> cut off his hands, and he was ultimately killed by S&#257;tyaki. After his death he merged into the existence of Vi&#347;vadeva.</div>

He was the King of Sindhude&#347;a (modern Sind Pakistan). His wife's name was <a href="/d/duhsala" class="d">Du&#7717;&#347;al&#257;</a>. He was also present in the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/svayamvara" class="d">svaya&#7745;vara</a></span> ceremony of <a href="/d/draupadi" class="d">Draupad&#299;</a>, and he desired very strongly to have her hand, but he failed in the competition. But since then he always sought the opportunity to get in touch with <a href="/d/draupadi" class="d">Draupad&#299;</a>. When he was going to marry in the &#346;alyade&#347;a, on the way to K&#257;myavana he happened to see <a href="/d/draupadi" class="d">Draupad&#299;</a> again and was too much attracted to her. The P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas and <a href="/d/draupadi" class="d">Draupad&#299;</a> were then in exile, after losing their empire in gambling, and Jayadratha thought it wise to send news to <a href="/d/draupadi" class="d">Draupad&#299;</a> in an illicit manner through Ko&#7789;i&#347;a&#7779;ya, one of his associates. <a href="/d/draupadi" class="d">Draupad&#299;</a> at once refused vehemently the proposal of Jayadratha, but being so much attracted by the beauty of <a href="/d/draupadi" class="d">Draupad&#299;</a>, he tried again and again. Every time he was refused by <a href="/d/draupadi" class="d">Draupad&#299;</a>. He tried to take her away forcibly on his chariot, and at first <a href="/d/draupadi" class="d">Draupad&#299;</a> gave him a good dashing, and he fell like a cut-root tree. But he was not discouraged, and he was able to force <a href="/d/draupadi" class="d">Draupad&#299;</a> to sit on the chariot. This incident was seen by <a href="/d/dhaumya" class="d">Dhaumya</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a>, and he strongly protested the action of Jayadratha. He also followed the chariot, and through Dh&#257;treyik&#257; the matter was brought to the notice of <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/yudhisthira" class="d">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira</a>. The P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas then attacked the soldiers of Jayadratha and killed them all, and at last <a href="/d/bhima" class="d">Bh&#299;ma</a> caught hold of Jayadratha and beat him very severely, almost dead. Then all but five hairs were cut off his head and he was taken to all the kings and introduced as the slave of <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/yudhisthira" class="d">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira</a>.

After this incident, he was allowed to return to his country. Being so insulted, he went to Ga&#7749;g&#257;tri in the Himalayas and undertook a severe type of penance to please Lord &#346;iva. He asked his benediction to defeat all the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas, at least one at a time. Then the Battle of <a href="/d/kuruksetra" class="d">Kuruk&#7779;etra</a> began, and he took sides with Duryodhana. In the first day's fight he was engaged with <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/drupada" class="d">Drupada</a>, then with <a href="/d/virata" class="d">Vir&#257;&#7789;a</a> and then with <a href="/d/abhimanyu" class="d">Abhimanyu</a>. While <a href="/d/abhimanyu" class="d">Abhimanyu</a> was being killed, mercilessly surrounded by seven great generals, the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas came to his help, but Jayadratha, by the mercy of Lord &#346;iva, repulsed them with great ability. At this, <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> took a vow to kill him, and on hearing this, Jayadratha wanted to leave the warfield and asked permission from the Kauravas for this cowardly action. But he was not allowed to do so. On the contrary, he was obliged to fight with <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a>, and while the fight was going on Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> reminded <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> that the benediction of &#346;iva upon Jayadratha was that whoever would cause his head to fall on the ground would die at once. He therefore advised <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> to throw the head of Jayadratha directly onto the lap of his father, who was engaged in penances at the <a href="/d/samanta" class="d">Samanta</a>-pa&ntilde;caka pilgrimage. This was actually done by <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a>. Jayadratha's father was surprised to see a severed head on his lap, and he at once threw it to the ground. The father immediately died, his forehead being cracked in seven pieces.</div>
