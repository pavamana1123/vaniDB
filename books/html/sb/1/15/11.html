<div class="Translation">During our exile, Durv&#257;s&#257; <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a>, who eats with his ten thousand disciples, intrigued with our enemies to put us in dangerous trouble. At that time He [Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>], simply by accepting the remnants of food, saved us. By His accepting food thus, the assembly of munis, while bathing in the river, felt sumptuously fed. And all the three worlds were also satisfied.</div>

<div class="First"><span class="Italic">Durv&#257;s&#257; <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a>:</span> A powerful mystic <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> determined to observe the principles of religion with great vows and under strict austerities. His name is associated with many historical events, and it appears that the great mystic could be both easily satisfied and easily annoyed, like Lord &#346;iva. When he was satisfied, he could do tremendous good to the servitor, but if he was dissatisfied he could bring about the greatest calamity. <a href="/d/kumari" class="d">Kum&#257;r&#299;</a> <a href="/d/kunti" class="d">Kunt&#299;</a>, at her father's house, used to minister all kinds of services to all great <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> and being satisfied with her good reception Durv&#257;s&#257; <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> blessed her with a power to call any demigod she desired. It is understood that he was a plenary incarnation of Lord &#346;iva, and thus he could be either easily satisfied or annoyed. He was a great devotee of Lord &#346;iva, and by Lord &#346;iva's order he accepted the priesthood of King &#346;vetaketu because of the King's performance of sacrifice for one hundred years. Sometimes he used to visit the parliamentary assembly of the heavenly kingdom of Indradeva. He could travel in space by his great mystic powers, and it is understood that he traveled a great distance through space, even up to the <a href="/d/vaikuntha" class="d">Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha</a> planets beyond material space. He traveled all these long distances within one year, during his quarrel with King <a href="/d/ambarisa" class="d">Ambar&#299;&#7779;a</a>, the great devotee and Emperor of the world.</div>
<A NAME="19644"></A><div id="19644"> </div>
<div class="Purport">He had about ten thousand disciples, and wherever he visited and became a guest of the great <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/ksatriya" class="d">k&#7779;atriya</a></span> kings, he used to be accompanied by a number of followers. Once he visited the house of Duryodhana, the enemy cousin of <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/yudhisthira" class="d">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira</a>. Duryodhana was intelligent enough to satisfy the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> by all means, and the great <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/rsi" class="d">&#7771;&#7779;i</a></span> wanted to give some benediction to Duryodhana. Duryodhana knew his mystic powers, and he knew also that the mystic <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a>,</span> if dissatisfied, could cause some havoc, and thus he designed to engage the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> to show his wrath upon his enemy cousins, the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas. When the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/rsi" class="d">&#7771;&#7779;i</a></span> wanted to award some benediction to Duryodhana, the latter wished that he should visit the house of <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/yudhisthira" class="d">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira</a>, who was the eldest and chief among all his cousins. But by his request he would go to him after he had finished his meals with his Queen, <a href="/d/draupadi" class="d">Draupad&#299;</a>. Duryodhana knew that after Draupad&#299;'s dinner it would be impossible for <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/yudhisthira" class="d">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira</a> to receive such a large number of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> guests, and thus the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/rsi" class="d">&#7771;&#7779;i</a></span> would be annoyed and would create some trouble for his cousin <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/yudhisthira" class="d">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira</a>. That was the plan of Duryodhana. Durv&#257;s&#257; <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> agreed to this proposal, and he approached the King in exile, according to the plan of Duryodhana, after the King and <a href="/d/draupadi" class="d">Draupad&#299;</a> had finished their meals.</div>
<A NAME="19645"></A><div id="19645"> </div>
<div class="Purport">On his arrival at the door of <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/yudhisthira" class="d">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira</a>, he was at once well received, and the King requested him to finish his noontime religious rites in the river, for by that time the foodstuff would be prepared. Durv&#257;s&#257; <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a>, along with his large number of disciples, went to take a bath in the river, and <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/yudhisthira" class="d">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira</a> was in great anxiety about the guests. As long as <a href="/d/draupadi" class="d">Draupad&#299;</a> had not taken her meals, food could be served to any number of guests, but the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/rsi" class="d">&#7771;&#7779;i</a>,</span> by the plan of Duryodhana, reached there after <a href="/d/draupadi" class="d">Draupad&#299;</a> had finished her meals.</div>
<A NAME="19646"></A><div id="19646"> </div>
<div class="Purport">When the devotees are put into difficulty, they have an opportunity to recollect the Lord with rapt attention. So <a href="/d/draupadi" class="d">Draupad&#299;</a> was thinking of Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> in that dangerous position, and the all-pervading Lord could at once know the dangerous position of His devotees. He therefore came there on the scene and asked <a href="/d/draupadi" class="d">Draupad&#299;</a> to give whatever food she might have in her stock. On her being so requested by the Lord, <a href="/d/draupadi" class="d">Draupad&#299;</a> was sorrowful because the Supreme Lord asked her for some food and she was unable to supply it at that time. She said to the Lord that the mysterious dish which she had received from the sun-god could supply any amount of food if she herself had not eaten. But on that day she had already taken her meals, and thus they were in danger. By expressing her difficulties she began to cry before the Lord as only a woman would do in such a position. The Lord, however, asked <a href="/d/draupadi" class="d">Draupad&#299;</a> to bring up the cooking pots to see if there was any particle of foodstuff left, and on Draupad&#299;'s doing so, the Lord found some particle of vegetable sticking to the pot. The Lord at once picked it up and ate it. After doing so, the Lord asked <a href="/d/draupadi" class="d">Draupad&#299;</a> to call for her guests, the company of Durv&#257;s&#257;.</div>
<A NAME="19647"></A><div id="19647"> </div>
<div class="Purport"><a href="/d/bhima" class="d">Bh&#299;ma</a> was sent to call them from the river. <a href="/d/bhima" class="d">Bh&#299;ma</a> said, "Why are you delaying, sirs? Come on, the food is ready for you." But the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> because of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's accepting a little particle of food, felt sumptuously fed, even while they were in the water. They thought that since <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/yudhisthira" class="d">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira</a> must have prepared many valuable dishes for them and since they were not hungry and could not eat, the King would feel very sorry, so it was better not to go there. Thus they decided to go away.</div>
<A NAME="19648"></A><div id="19648"> </div>
<div class="Purport">This incident proves that the Lord is the greatest mystic, and therefore He is known as <a href="/d/yogesvara" class="d">Yoge&#347;vara</a>. Another instruction is that every householder must offer food to the Lord, and the result will be that everyone, even a company of guests numbering ten thousand, will be satisfied because of the Lord's being satisfied. That is the way of devotional service.</div>
