<div class="First">Exceptionally qualified daughters of powerful kings were allowed to make a choice of their own bridegrooms in open competition, and such ceremonies were called <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/svayamvara" class="d">svaya&#7745;vara</a>,</span> or selection of the bridegroom. Because the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/svayamvara" class="d">svaya&#7745;vara</a></span> was an open competition between the rival and valiant princes, such princes were invited by the father of the princess, and usually there were regular fights between the invited princely order in a sporting spirit. But it so happened that sometimes the belligerent princes were killed in such marriage-fighting, and the victorious prince was offered the trophy princess for whom so many princes died. <a href="/d/rukmini" class="d">Rukmi&#7751;&#299;</a>, the principal queen of Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, was the daughter of the King of <a href="/d/vidarbha" class="d">Vidarbha</a>, who wished that his qualified and beautiful daughter be given away to Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. But her eldest brother wanted her to be given away to King &#346;i&#347;up&#257;la, who happened to be a cousin of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. So there was open competition, and as usual Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> emerged successful, after harassing &#346;i&#347;up&#257;la and other princes by His unrivalled prowess. <a href="/d/rukmini" class="d">Rukmi&#7751;&#299;</a> had ten sons, like <a href="/d/pradyumna" class="d">Pradyumna</a>. There were other queens also taken away by Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> in a similar way. Full description of this beautiful booty of Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> will be given in the Tenth Canto. There were 16,100 beautiful girls who were daughters of many kings and were forcibly stolen by Bhaum&#257;sura, who kept them captive for his carnal desire. These girls prayed piteously to Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> for their deliverance, and the merciful Lord, called by their fervent prayer, released them all by fighting and killing Bhaum&#257;sura. All these captive princesses were then accepted by the Lord as His wives, although in the estimation of society they were all fallen girls. The all-powerful Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> accepted the humble prayers of these girls and married them with the adoration of queens. So altogether Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> had 16,108 queens at <a href="/d/dvaraka" class="d">Dv&#257;rak&#257;</a>, and in each of them He begot ten children. All these children grew up, and each had as many children as the father. The aggregate of the family numbered 10,000,000.</div>
