<div class="Translation">Upon returning, he began to contemplate and argue within himself whether the sage had actually been in meditation, with senses concentrated and eyes closed, or whether he had just been feigning trance just to avoid receiving a lower <a href="/d/ksatriya" class="d">k&#7779;atriya</a>.<span class="Italic"></span></div>

<div class="First">The King, being a devotee of the Lord, did not approve of his own action, and thus he began to wonder whether the sage was really in a trance or was just pretending in order to avoid receiving the King, who was a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/ksatriya" class="d">k&#7779;atriya</a></span> and therefore lower in rank. Repentance comes in the mind of a good soul as soon as he commits something wrong. &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha <a href="/d/cakravarti" class="d">Cakravart&#299;</a> &#7788;h&#257;kura and &#346;r&#299;la <a href="/d/jiva" class="d">J&#299;va</a> Gosv&#257;m&#299; do not believe that the King's action was due to his past misdeeds. The arrangement was so made by the Lord just to call the King back home, back to Godhead.</div>
<A NAME="21745"></A><div id="21745"> </div>
<div class="Purport">According to &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha <a href="/d/cakravarti" class="d">Cakravart&#299;</a>, the plan was made by the will of the Lord, and by the will of the Lord the situation of frustration was created. The plan was that for his so-called misdeed the King could be cursed by an inexperienced <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> boy infected by the influence of <a href="/d/kali" class="d">Kali</a>, and thus the King would leave his hearth and home for good. His connections with &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; would enable the presentation of the great <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a>,</span> which is considered to be the book incarnation of the Lord. This book incarnation of the Lord gives much fascinating information of the transcendental pastimes of the Lord, like His <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/rasa" class="d">r&#257;sa</a>-<a href="/d/lila" class="d">l&#299;la</a></span> with the spiritual cowherd damsels of Vrajabh&#363;mi. This specific pastime of the Lord has a special significance because anyone who properly learns about this particular pastime of the Lord will certainly be dissuaded from mundane sex desire and be placed on the path of sublime devotional service to the Lord. The pure devotee's mundane frustration is meant to elevate the devotee to a higher transcendental position. By placing <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> and the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas in frustration due to the intrigue of their cousin-brothers, the prelude of the Battle of <a href="/d/kuruksetra" class="d">Kuruk&#7779;etra</a> was created by the Lord. This was to incarnate the sound representative of the Lord, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a>.</span> So by placing King <a href="/d/pariksit" class="d">Par&#299;k&#7779;it</a> in an awkward position, the incarnation of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a></span> was created by the will of the Lord. Being distressed by hunger and thirst was only a show, because the King endured much, even in the womb of his mother. He was never disturbed by the glaring heat of the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmastra" class="d">brahm&#257;stra</a></span> released by <a href="/d/asvatthama" class="d">A&#347;vatth&#257;m&#257;</a>. The King's distressed condition was certainly unprecedented. The devotees like <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/pariksit" class="d">Par&#299;k&#7779;it</a> are powerful enough to forbear such distresses, by the will of the Lord, and they are never disturbed. The situation, in this case, was therefore all planned by the Lord.</div>
