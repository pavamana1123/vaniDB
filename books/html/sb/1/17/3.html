<div class="Translation">Although the cow is beneficial because one can draw religious principles from her, she was now rendered poor and calfless. Her legs were being beaten by a <a href="/d/sudra" class="d">&#347;&#363;dra</a>. There were tears in her eyes, and she was distressed and weak. She was hankering after some grass in the field.</div>

<div class="First">The next symptom of the age of <a href="/d/kali" class="d">Kali</a> is the distressed condition of the cow. Milking the cow means drawing the principles of religion in a liquid form. The great <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;is</span> and <span class="Italic">munis</span> would live only on milk. &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; would go to a householder while he was milking a cow, and he would simply take a little quantity of it for subsistence. Even fifty years ago, no one would deprive a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sadhu" class="d">s&#257;dhu</a></span> of a quart or two of milk, and every householder would give milk like water. For a San&#257;tanist (a follower of Vedic principles) it is the duty of every householder to have cows and bulls as household paraphernalia, not only for drinking milk, but also for deriving religious principles. The San&#257;tanist worships cows on religious principles and respects <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as.</span> The cow's milk is required for the sacrificial fire, and by performing sacrifices the householder can be happy. The cow's calf not only is beautiful to look at, but also gives satisfaction to the cow, and so she delivers as much milk as possible. But in the <a href="/d/kali" class="d">Kali</a>-<a href="/d/yuga" class="d">yuga</a>, the calves are separated from the cows as early as possible for purposes which may not be mentioned in these pages of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a>.</span> The cow stands with tears in her eyes, the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sudra" class="d">&#347;&#363;dra</a></span> milkman draws milk from the cow artificially, and when there is no milk the cow is sent to be slaughtered. These greatly sinful acts are responsible for all the troubles in present society. People do not know what they are doing in the name of economic development. The influence of <a href="/d/kali" class="d">Kali</a> will keep them in the darkness of ignorance. Despite all endeavors for peace and prosperity, they must try to see the cows and the bulls happy in all respects. Foolish people do not know how one earns happiness by making the cows and bulls happy, but it is a fact by the law of nature. Let us take it from the authority of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a></span> and adopt the principles for the total happiness of humanity.</div>
