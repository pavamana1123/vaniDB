<div class="Translation"><a href="/d/suta" class="d">S&#363;ta</a> Gosv&#257;m&#299; said: <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/pariksit" class="d">Par&#299;k&#7779;it</a>, thus being petitioned by the personality of <a href="/d/kali" class="d">Kali</a>, gave him permission to reside in places where gambling, drinking, prostitution and animal slaughter were performed.</div>

<div class="First">The basic principles of irreligiosity, such as pride, prostitution, intoxication and falsehood, counteract the four principles of religion, namely austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness. The personality of <a href="/d/kali" class="d">Kali</a> was given permission to live in four places particularly mentioned by the King, namely the place of gambling, the place of prostitution, the place of drinking and the place of animal slaughter.</div>
<A NAME="21211"></A><div id="21211"> </div>
<div class="Purport">&#346;r&#299;la <a href="/d/jiva" class="d">J&#299;va</a> Gosv&#257;m&#299; directs that drinking against the principles of scriptures, such as the <span class="Italic">sautr&#257;ma&#7751;&#299;-<a href="/d/yajna" class="d">yaj&ntilde;a</a>,</span> association with women outside marriage, and killing animals against the injunctions of scriptures are irreligious. In the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> two different types of injunctions are there for the <span class="Italic">prav&#7771;ttas,</span> or those who are engaged in material enjoyment, and for the <span class="Italic">niv&#7771;ttas,</span> or those who are liberated from material bondage. The Vedic injunction for the <span class="Italic">prav&#7771;ttas</span> is to gradually regulate their activities towards the path of liberation. Therefore, for those who are in the lowest stage of ignorance and who indulge in wine, women and flesh, drinking by performing <span class="Italic">sautr&#257;ma&#7751;&#299;-<a href="/d/yajna" class="d">yaj&ntilde;a</a>,</span> association of women by marriage and flesh-eating by sacrifices are sometimes recommended. Such recommendations in the Vedic literature are meant for a particular class of men, and not for all. But because they are injunctions of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> for particular types of persons, such activities by the <span class="Italic">prav&#7771;ttas</span> are not considered <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/adharma" class="d">adharma</a>.</span> One man's food may be poison for others; similarly, what is recommended for those in the mode of ignorance may be poison for those in the mode of goodness. &#346;r&#299;la <a href="/d/jiva" class="d">J&#299;va</a> Gosv&#257;m&#299; <a href="/d/prabhu" class="d">Prabhu</a>, therefore, affirms that recommendations in the scriptures for a certain class of men are never to be considered <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/adharma" class="d">adharma</a>,</span> or irreligious. But such activities are factually <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/adharma" class="d">adharma</a>,</span> and they are never to be encouraged. The recommendations in the scriptures are not meant for the encouragement of such <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/adharma" class="d">adharma</a>,</span> but for regulating the necessary <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/adharma" class="d">adharma</a></span> gradually toward the path of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/dharma" class="d">dharma</a>.</span></div>
<A NAME="21212"></A><div id="21212"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Following in the footsteps of <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/pariksit" class="d">Par&#299;k&#7779;it</a>, it is the duty of all executive heads of states to see that the principles of religion, namely austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness, are established in the state, and that the principles of irreligion, namely pride, illicit female association or prostitution, intoxication and falsity, are checked by all means. And to make the best use of a bad bargain, the personality of <a href="/d/kali" class="d">Kali</a> may be transferred to places of gambling, drinking, prostitution and slaughterhouses, if there are any places like that. Those who are addicted to these irreligious habits may be regulated by the injunctions of the scripture. In no circumstances should they be encouraged by any state. In other words, the state should categorically stop all sorts of gambling, drinking, prostitution and falsity. The state which wants to eradicate corruption by majority may introduce the principles of religion in the following manner:</div>
<A NAME="21213"></A><div id="21213"> </div>
<div class="Purport">1. Two compulsory fasting days in a month, if not more (austerity). Even from the economic point of view, such two fasting days in a month in the state will save tons of food, and the system will also act very favorably on the general health of the citizens.</div>
<A NAME="21214"></A><div id="21214"> </div>
<div class="Purport">2. There must be compulsory marriage of young boys and girls attaining twenty-four years of age and sixteen years of age respectively. There is no harm in coeducation in the schools and colleges, provided the boys and girls are duly married, and in case there is any intimate connection between a male and female student, they should be married properly without illicit relation. The divorce act is encouraging prostitution, and this should be abolished.</div>
<A NAME="21215"></A><div id="21215"> </div>
<div class="Purport">3. The citizens of the state must give in charity up to fifty percent of their income for the purpose of creating a spiritual atmosphere in the state or in human society, both individually and collectively. They should preach the principles of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a></span> by (a) <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/karma" class="d">karma</a>-<a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a>,</span> or doing everything for the satisfaction of the Lord, (b) regular hearing of the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a></span> from authorized persons or realized souls, (c) chanting of the glories of the Lord congregationally at home or at places of worship, (d) rendering all kinds of service to <span class="Italic">bh&#257;gavatas</span> engaged in preaching <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a></span> and (e) residing in a place where the atmosphere is saturated with God consciousness. If the state is regulated by the above process, naturally there will be God consciousness everywhere.</div>
<A NAME="21216"></A><div id="21216"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Gambling of all description, even speculative business enterprise, is considered to be degrading, and when gambling is encouraged in the state, there is a complete disappearance of truthfulness. Allowing young boys and girls to remain unmarried more than the above-mentioned ages and licensing animal slaughterhouses of all description should be at once prohibited. The flesh-eaters may be allowed to take flesh as mentioned in the scriptures, and not otherwise. Intoxication of all description-even smoking cigarettes, chewing tobacco or the drinking of tea-must be prohibited.</div>
