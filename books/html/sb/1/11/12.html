<div class="First">Perfection of human civilization is made possible by utilizing the gifts of nature in their own way. As we find herewith in the description of its opulence, <a href="/d/dvaraka" class="d">Dv&#257;rak&#257;</a> was surrounded by flower gardens and fruit orchards along with reservoirs of water and growing lotuses. There is no mention of mills and factories supported by slaughterhouses, which are the necessary paraphernalia of the modern metropolis. The propensity to utilize nature's own gifts is still there, even in the heart of modern civilized man. The leaders of modern civilization select their own residential quarters in a place where there are such naturally beautiful gardens and reservoirs of water, but they leave the common men to reside in congested areas without parks and gardens. Herein of course we find a different description of the city of <a href="/d/dvaraka" class="d">Dv&#257;rak&#257;</a>. It is understood that the whole <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/dhama" class="d">dh&#257;ma</a>,</span> or residential quarter, was surrounded by such gardens and parks with reservoirs of water where lotuses grew. It is understood that all the people depended on nature's gifts of fruits and flowers without industrial enterprises promoting filthy huts and slums for residential quarters. Advancement of civilization is estimated not on the growth of mills and factories to deteriorate the finer instincts of the human being, but on developing the potent spiritual instincts of human beings and giving them a chance to go back to Godhead. Development of factories and mills is called <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/ugra" class="d">ugra</a>-<a href="/d/karma" class="d">karma</a>,</span> or pungent activities, and such activities deteriorate the finer sentiments of the human being and society to form a dungeon of demons.</div>
<A NAME="17133"></A><div id="17133"> </div>
<div class="Purport">We find herein the mention of pious trees which produce seasonal flowers and fruits. The impious trees are useless jungles only, and they can only be used to supply fuels. In the modern civilization such impious trees are planted on the sides of roads. Human energy should be properly utilized in developing the finer senses for spiritual understanding, in which lies the solution of life. Fruits, flowers, beautiful gardens, parks and reservoirs of water with ducks and swans playing in the midst of lotus flowers, and cows giving sufficient milk and butter are essential for developing the finer tissues of the human body. As against this, the dungeons of mines, factories and workshops develop demoniac propensities in the working class. The vested interests flourish at the cost of the working class, and consequently there are severe clashes between them in so many ways. The description of <a href="/d/dvaraka" class="d">Dv&#257;rak&#257;</a>-<a href="/d/dhama" class="d">dh&#257;ma</a> is the ideal of human civilization.</div>
