<div class="Translation">The Lord's chest is the abode of the goddess of fortune. His moonlike face is the drinking vessel for eyes which hanker after all that is beautiful.

<div class="VerseRef">(Bs. 5.29)<LT>* the transcendental abode of the Lord where the trees are all desire trees and the buildings are made of touchstone. The Lord <a href="/d/govinda" class="d">Govinda</a> is engaged there in herding the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/surabhi" class="d">surabhi</a></span> cows as His natural occupation. These goddesses of fortune can be seen automatically if we are attracted by the bodily features of the Lord. The impersonalists cannot observe such goddesses of fortune because of their dry speculative habit. And those who are artists, overtaken by the beautiful creation, should better see to the beautiful face of the Lord for complete satisfaction. The face of the Lord is the embodiment of beauty. What they call beautiful nature is but His smile, and what they call the sweet songs of the birds are but specimens of the whispering voice of the Lord. There are administrative demigods in charge of departmental service of cosmic management, and there are tiny administrative gods in the state service. They are always afraid of other competitors, but if they take shelter of the arms of the Lord, the Lord can protect them always from the attacks of enemies. A faithful servant of the Lord engaged in the service of administration is the ideal executive head and can well protect the interest of the people in general. Other so-called administrators are symbols of anachronisms leading to the acute distress of the people who are governed by them. The administrators can remain safely under the protection of the arms of the Lord. The essence of everything is the Supreme Lord: He is called the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/saram" class="d">s&#257;ram</a>.</span> And those who sing and talk about Him are called the <span class="Italic">s&#257;ra&#7749;gas,</span> or the pure devotees. The pure devotees are always hankering after the lotus feet of the Lord. The lotus has a kind of honey which is transcendentally relished by the devotees. They are like the bees who are always after the honey. &#346;r&#299;la <a href="/d/rupa" class="d">R&#363;pa</a> Gosv&#257;m&#299;, the great devotee <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/acarya" class="d">&#257;c&#257;rya</a></span> of the <a href="/d/gaudiya" class="d">Gau&#7693;&#299;ya</a>-<a href="/d/vaisnava" class="d">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava</a>-<a href="/d/sampradaya" class="d">samprad&#257;ya</a>, has sung a song about this lotus honey, comparing himself to the bee: "O my Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, I beg to offer my prayers unto You. My mind is like the bee, and it is after some honey. Kindly, therefore, give my bee-mind a place at Your lotus feet, which are the resources for all transcendental honey. I know that even big demigods like <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> do not see the rays of the nails of Your lotus feet, even though they are engaged in deep meditation for years together. Still, O infallible one, my ambition is such, for You are very merciful to your surrendered devotees. O <a href="/d/madhava" class="d">M&#257;dhava</a>, I know also that I have no genuine devotion for the service of Your lotus feet, but because Your Lordship is inconceivably powerful, You can do what is impossible to be done. Your lotus feet can deride even the nectar of the heavenly kingdom, and therefore I am very much attracted by them. O supreme eternal, please, therefore, let my mind be fixed at Your lotus feet so that eternally I may be able to relish the taste of Your transcendental service." The devotees are satisfied with being placed at the lotus feet of the Lord and have no ambition to see His all-beautiful face or aspire for the protection of the strong arms of the Lord. They are humble by nature, and the Lord is always leaning towards such humble devotees.</div>
