<div class="First">We may not <a href="/d/hate" class="d">hate</a> even the prostitutes if they are devotees of the Lord. Even to date there are many prostitutes in great cities of India who are sincere devotees of the Lord. By tricks of chance one may be obliged to adopt a profession which is not very adorable in society, but that does not hamper one in executing devotional service to the Lord. Devotional service to the Lord is uncheckable in all circumstances. It is understood herewith that even in those days, about five thousand years ago, there were prostitutes in a city like <a href="/d/dvaraka" class="d">Dv&#257;rak&#257;</a>, where Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> resided. This means that prostitutes are necessary citizens for the proper upkeep of society. The government opens wine shops, but this does not mean that the government encourages the drinking of wine. The idea is that there is a class of men who will drink at any cost, and it has been experienced that prohibition in great cities encouraged illicit smuggling of wine. Similarly, men who are not satisfied at home require such concessions, and if there is no prostitute, then such low men will induce others into prostitution. It is better that prostitutes be available in the marketplace so that the sanctity of society can be maintained. It is better to maintain a class of prostitutes than to encourage prostitutes within society. The real reformation is to enlighten all people to become devotees of the Lord, and that will check all kinds of deteriorating factors of life.</div>

<div class="Purport">&#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/bilvamangala" class="d">Bilvama&#7749;gala</a> &#7788;h&#257;kura, a great <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/acarya" class="d">&#257;c&#257;rya</a></span> of the Vi&#7779;&#7751;usv&#257;m&#299; <a href="/d/vaisnava" class="d">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava</a> sect, in his householder life was overly attached to a prostitute who happened to be a devotee of the Lord. One night when the &#7788;h&#257;kura came to Cint&#257;ma&#7751;i's house in torrents of rain and thunder, <a href="/d/cintamani" class="d">Cint&#257;ma&#7751;i</a> was astonished to see how the &#7788;h&#257;kura could come on such a dreadful night after crossing a foaming river which was full of waves. She said to &#7788;h&#257;kura <a href="/d/bilvamangala" class="d">Bilvama&#7749;gala</a> that his attraction for the flesh and bone of an insignificant woman like her would be properly utilized if it could be diverted to the devotional service of the Lord to achieve attraction for the transcendental beauty of the Lord. It was a momentous hour for the &#7788;h&#257;kura, and he took a turn towards spiritual realization by the words of a prostitute. Later on the &#7788;h&#257;kura accepted the prostitute as his spiritual master, and in several places of his literary works he has glorified the name of <a href="/d/cintamani" class="d">Cint&#257;ma&#7751;i</a>, who showed him the right path.</div>
<A NAME="17233"></A><div id="17233"> </div>
<div class="Purport">In the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span></B> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/9/32?d=1">9.32</a>) the Lord says, "O son of <a href="/d/prtha" class="d">P&#7771;th&#257;</a>, even the low-born <span class="Italic">ca&#7751;&#7693;&#257;las</span> and those who are born in a family of unbelievers, and even the prostitutes, shall attain perfection of life if they take shelter of unalloyed devotional service to Me, because in the path of devotional service there are no impediments due to degraded birth and occupation. The path is open for everyone who agrees to follow it."</div>
<A NAME="17234"></A><div id="17234"> </div>
<div class="Purport">It appears that the prostitutes of <a href="/d/dvaraka" class="d">Dv&#257;rak&#257;</a>, who were so eager to meet the Lord, were all His unalloyed devotees, and thus they were all on the path of salvation according to the above version of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a>.</span> Therefore, the only reformation that is necessary in society is to make an organized effort to turn the citizens into devotees of the Lord, and thus all good qualities of the denizens of heaven will overtake them in their own way. On the other hand, those who are nondevotees have no good qualifications whatsoever, however they may be materially advanced. The difference is that the devotees of the Lord are on the path of liberation, whereas the nondevotees are on the path of further entanglement in material bondage. The criterion of advancement of civilization is whether the people are educated and advanced on the path of salvation.</div>
