His minister was <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">Vasudeva</a>, and his son was the powerful <a href="/d/kamsa" class="d">Ka&#7745;sa</a>. This <a href="/d/kamsa" class="d">Ka&#7745;sa</a> imprisoned his father and became the King of <a href="/d/mathura" class="d">Mathur&#257;</a>.

He cut the iron lump into pieces and then pasted it and mixed it up with the sea water on the coast of <a href="/d/dvaraka" class="d">Dv&#257;rak&#257;</a>.

He is also known as <a href="/d/rohini" class="d">Rohi&#7751;&#299;</a>-<a href="/d/nandana" class="d">nandana</a>, the beloved son of <a href="/d/rohini" class="d">Rohi&#7751;&#299;</a>.

So <a href="/d/nanda" class="d">Nanda</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> is also the foster father of <a href="/d/baladeva" class="d">Baladeva</a> along with Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> and Lord <a href="/d/baladeva" class="d">Baladeva</a> were constant companions from Their very childhood, although They were stepbrothers. He is the plenary manifestation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore He is as good and powerful as Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. He belongs to the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/visnu" class="d">vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a>-<a href="/d/tattva" class="d">tattva</a></span> (the principle of Godhead). He attended the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/svayamvara" class="d">svaya&#7745;vara</a></span> ceremony of <a href="/d/draupadi" class="d">Draupad&#299;</a> along with &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. When <a href="/d/subhadra" class="d">Subhadr&#257;</a> was kidnapped by <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> by the organized plan of &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, <a href="/d/baladeva" class="d">Baladeva</a> was very angry with <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> and wanted to kill him at once. &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, for the sake of His dear friend, fell at the feet of Lord <a href="/d/baladeva" class="d">Baladeva</a> and implored Him not to be so angry. &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/baladeva" class="d">Baladeva</a> was thus satisfied. Similarly, He was once very angry with the Kauravas, and He wanted to throw their whole city into the depths of the <a href="/d/yamuna" class="d">Yamun&#257;</a>. But the Kauravas satisfied Him by surrendering unto His divine lotus feet. He was actually the seventh son of <a href="/d/devaki" class="d">Devak&#299;</a> prior to the birth of Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, but by the will of the Lord He was transferred to the womb of <a href="/d/rohini" class="d">Rohi&#7751;&#299;</a> to escape the wrath of <a href="/d/kamsa" class="d">Ka&#7745;sa</a>. His other name is therefore <a href="/d/sankarsana" class="d">Sa&#7749;kar&#7779;a&#7751;a</a>, who is also the plenary portion of &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/baladeva" class="d">Baladeva</a>. Because He is as powerful as Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> and can bestow spiritual power to the devotees, He is therefore known as <a href="/d/baladeva" class="d">Baladeva</a>. In the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> also it is enjoined that no one can know the Supreme Lord without being favored by <a href="/d/baladeva" class="d">Baladeva</a>. <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bala" class="d">Bala</a></span> means spiritual strength not physical. Some less intelligent persons interpret <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bala" class="d">bala</a></span> as the strength of the body. But no one can have spiritual realization by physical strength. Physical strength ends with the end of the physical body, but spiritual strength follows the spirit soul to the next transmigration, and therefore the strength obtained by <a href="/d/baladeva" class="d">Baladeva</a> is never wasted. The strength is eternal, and thus <a href="/d/baladeva" class="d">Baladeva</a> is the original spiritual master of all devotees.</div>

He was in favor of Duryodhana, but still He remained neutral. When there was a club-fight between Duryodhana and <a href="/d/bhimasena" class="d">Bh&#299;masena</a>, He was present on the spot. He was angry at <a href="/d/bhimasena" class="d">Bh&#299;masena</a> when the latter struck Duryodhana on the thigh or below the belt, and He wanted to retaliate the unfair action.

The funeral ceremony of <a href="/d/abhimanyu" class="d">Abhimanyu</a>, the son of <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a>, was performed by Him, as He was the maternal uncle. It was impossible to be performed by any one of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas, who were all overwhelmed with grief. At the last stage, He departed from this world by producing a great white snake from His mouth, and thus He was carried by &#346;e&#7779;an&#257;ga in the shape of a serpent.</div>
