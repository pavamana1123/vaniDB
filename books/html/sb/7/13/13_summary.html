<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">This Thirteenth Chapter describes the regulative principles for <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;s</span> and also describes the history of an <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/avadhuta" class="d">avadh&#363;ta</a>.</span> It concludes with a description of perfection for the student in spiritual advancement.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">&#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> has been describing the symptoms of various <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;ramas</span> and <span class="Italic">var&#7751;as.</span> Now, in this chapter, he specifically describes the regulative principles to be followed by <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;s.</span> After retiring from family life, one should accept the status of <span class="Italic">v&#257;naprastha,</span> in which he must formally accept the body as his means of existence but gradually forget the bodily necessities of life. After <span class="Italic">v&#257;naprastha</span> life, having left home, one should travel to different places as a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sannyasi" class="d">sanny&#257;s&#299;</a>.</span> Without bodily comforts and free from dependence on anyone with respect to bodily necessities, one should travel everywhere, wearing almost nothing or actually walking naked. Without association with ordinary human society, one should beg alms and always be satisfied in himself. One should be a friend to every living entity and be very peaceful in <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness. A <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sannyasi" class="d">sanny&#257;s&#299;</a></span> should travel alone in this way, not caring for life or death, waiting for the time when he will leave his material body. He should not indulge in unnecessary books or adopt professions like astrology, nor should he try to become a great orator. He should also give up the path of unnecessary argument and should not depend on anyone under any circumstances. He should not try to allure people into becoming his disciples just so that the number of his disciples may increase. He should give up the habit of reading many books as a means of livelihood, and he should not attempt to increase the number of temples and <span class="Italic">ma&#7789;has,</span> or monasteries. When a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sannyasi" class="d">sanny&#257;s&#299;</a></span> thus becomes completely independent, peaceful and equipoised, he can select the destination he desires after death and follow the principles by which to reach that destination. Although fully learned, he should always remain silent, like a dumb person, and travel like a restless child.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">In this regard, <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> described a meeting between <a href="/d/prahlada" class="d">Prahl&#257;da</a> and a saintly person who had adopted the mode of life of a python. In this way he described the symptoms of a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/paramahamsa" class="d">paramaha&#7745;sa</a>.</span> A person who has attained the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/paramahamsa" class="d">paramaha&#7745;sa</a></span> stage knows very well the distinction between matter and spirit. He is not at all interested in gratifying the material senses, for he is always deriving pleasure from devotional service to the Lord. He is not very anxious to protect his material body. Being satisfied with whatever he attains by the grace of the Lord, he is completely independent of material happiness and distress, and thus he is transcendental to all regulative principles. Sometimes he accepts severe austerities, and sometimes he accepts material opulence. His only concern is to satisfy <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, and for that purpose he can do anything and everything, without reference to the regulative principles. He is never to be equated with materialistic men, nor is he subject to the judgments of such men.</div>
