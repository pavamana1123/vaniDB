<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">The summary of the Fifteenth Chapter is as follows. In the previous chapter, &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> proved the importance of the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> in society. Now, in this chapter, he will show the differences between different grades of <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as.</span> Among the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> some are householders and are mostly attached to fruitive activities or the betterment of social conditions. Above them, however, are <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> who are very much attracted by austerities and penances and who retire from family life. They are known as <span class="Italic">v&#257;naprasthas.</span> Other <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> are very much interested in studying the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> and explaining the purport of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> to others. Such <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> are called <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;s.</span> And still other <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> are interested in different types of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a>,</span> especially <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">bhakti</a>-<a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> and <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/jnana" class="d">j&ntilde;&#257;na</a>-<a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a>.</span> Such <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> are mostly <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;s,</span> members of the renounced order of life.</div>
</div><A NAME="95737"></A><div id="95737"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">As far as householders are concerned, they engage in different types of scriptural activities, especially in offering oblations to their forefathers and giving as charity to other <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> the paraphernalia engaged in such sacrifices. Generally the charity is given to <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;s, br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> in the renounced order of life. If such a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sannyasi" class="d">sanny&#257;s&#299;</a></span> is not available, the charity is given to <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> householders engaged in fruitive activities.</div>
</div><A NAME="95738"></A><div id="95738"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">One should not make very elaborate arrangements to perform the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sraddha" class="d">&#347;r&#257;ddha</a></span> ceremony of offering oblations to one&rsquo;s forefathers. The best process for the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sraddha" class="d">&#347;r&#257;ddha</a></span> ceremony is to distribute <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhagavata" class="d">bh&#257;gavata</a>-<a href="/d/prasada" class="d">pras&#257;da</a></span> (remnants of food that has first been offered to <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>) to all of one&rsquo;s forefathers and relatives. This makes a first-class <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sraddha" class="d">&#347;r&#257;ddha</a></span> ceremony. In the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sraddha" class="d">&#347;r&#257;ddha</a></span> ceremony there is no need to offer meat or eat meat. Unnecessary killing of animals must be avoided. Those who are in the lower grades of society prefer to perform sacrifices by killing animals, but one who is advanced in knowledge must avoid such unnecessary violence.</div>
</div><A NAME="95739"></A><div id="95739"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Italic">Br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> should execute their regulative duties in worshiping Lord <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a>. Those who are advanced in knowledge of religious principles must avoid five kinds of irreligion, known as <span class="Italic">vidharma, <a href="/d/para" class="d">para</a>-<a href="/d/dharma" class="d">dharma</a>, dharm&#257;bh&#257;sa, <a href="/d/upadharma" class="d">upadharma</a></span> and <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/chala" class="d">chala</a>-<a href="/d/dharma" class="d">dharma</a>.</span> One must act according to the religious principles that suit his constitutional position; it is not that everyone must adhere to the same type of religion. A general principle is that a poor man should not unnecessarily endeavor for economic development. One who refrains from such endeavors but who engages in devotional service is most auspicious.</div>
</div><A NAME="95740"></A><div id="95740"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">One who is not satisfied with the mind must fall to degradation. One must conquer lusty desires, anger, greed, fear, lamentation, illusion, fright, unnecessary talks on material subjects, violence, the four miseries of material existence, and the three material qualities. That is the objective of human life. One who has no faith in the spiritual master, who is identical with &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, cannot get any benefit from reading <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sastra" class="d">&#347;&#257;stra</a>.</span> One should never consider the spiritual master an ordinary human being, even though the members of the spiritual master&rsquo;s family may think of him as such. Meditation and other processes of austerity are useful only if they help in advancement toward <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness; otherwise, they are simply a waste of time and labor. For those who are not devotees, such meditation and austerity cause falldown.</div>
</div><A NAME="95741"></A><div id="95741"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Every householder should be very careful because even though a householder may try to conquer the senses, he becomes a victim to the association of relatives and falls down. Thus a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/grhastha" class="d">g&#7771;hastha</a></span> must become a <span class="Italic">v&#257;naprastha</span> or <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sannyasi" class="d">sanny&#257;s&#299;</a>,</span> live in a secluded place, and be satisfied with food gotten by begging from door to door. He must chant the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/omkara" class="d">o&#7745;k&#257;ra</a> <a href="/d/mantra" class="d">mantra</a></span> or <a href="/d/hare" class="d">Hare</a> <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/mantra" class="d">mantra</a>,</span> and in this way he will perceive transcendental bliss within himself. After taking <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sannyasa" class="d">sanny&#257;sa</a>,</span> however, if one returns to <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/grhastha" class="d">g&#7771;hastha</a></span> life, he is called a <span class="Italic">v&#257;nt&#257;&#347;&#299;,</span> which means &ldquo;one who eats his own vomit.&rdquo; Such a person is shameless. A householder should not give up the ritualistic ceremonies, and a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sannyasi" class="d">sanny&#257;s&#299;</a></span> should not live in society. If a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sannyasi" class="d">sanny&#257;s&#299;</a></span> is agitated by the senses, he is a cheater influenced by the modes of passion and ignorance. When one assumes a role in goodness by starting philanthropic and altruistic activities, such activities become impediments on the path of devotional service.</div>
</div><A NAME="95742"></A><div id="95742"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">The best process for advancing in devotional service is to abide by the orders of the spiritual master, for only by his direction can one conquer the senses. Unless one is completely <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> conscious, there is a chance of falling down. Of course, in performing ritualistic ceremonies and other fruitive activities there are also many dangers at every moment. Fruitive activities have been divided into twelve portions. Because of performing fruitive activities, which are called the path of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/dharma" class="d">dharma</a>,</span> one has to accept the cycle of birth and death, but when one takes the path of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/moksa" class="d">mok&#7779;a</a>,</span> or liberation, which is described in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> as <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/arcana" class="d">arcan&#257;</a>-<a href="/d/marga" class="d">m&#257;rga</a>,</span> one can get relief from the cycle of birth and death. The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> describe these two paths as <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/pitr" class="d">pit&#7771;</a>-<a href="/d/yana" class="d">y&#257;na</a></span> and <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/deva" class="d">deva</a>-<a href="/d/yana" class="d">y&#257;na</a>.</span> Those who follow the paths of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/pitr" class="d">pit&#7771;</a>-<a href="/d/yana" class="d">y&#257;na</a></span> and <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/deva" class="d">deva</a>-<a href="/d/yana" class="d">y&#257;na</a></span> are never bewildered, even while in the material body. A monistic philosopher who gradually develops control of the senses understands that the objective of all the different <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;ramas,</span> the statuses of life, is salvation. One must live and act according to <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras.</span></div>
</div><A NAME="95743"></A><div id="95743"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">If one who is performing the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies becomes a devotee, even if he is a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/grhastha" class="d">g&#7771;hastha</a>,</span> he can receive the causeless mercy of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. The objective of a devotee is to return home, back to Godhead. Such a devotee, even though not performing ritualistic ceremonies, advances in spiritual consciousness by the supreme will of the Personality of Godhead. One may actually become successful in spiritual consciousness by the mercy of devotees, or one may fall from spiritual consciousness by being disrespectful to devotees. In this regard, <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> narrated the history of how he had fallen from the <a href="/d/gandharva" class="d">Gandharva</a> kingdom, how he was born in a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sudra" class="d">&#347;&#363;dra</a></span> family, and how by serving exalted <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> he became the son of Lord <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> and was reinstated in his transcendental position. After narrating all these stories, <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> praised the mercy received from the Lord by the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas. <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/yudhisthira" class="d">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira</a>, after hearing from <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a>, became ecstatic in love of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, and then <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> left that place and returned to his own place. Thus &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, having described various descendants of the daughters of <a href="/d/daksa" class="d">Dak&#7779;a</a>, ends the Seventh Canto of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a>.</span></div>
