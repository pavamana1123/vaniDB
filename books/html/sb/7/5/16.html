<div class="Translation">Oh, please bring me a stick! This <a href="/d/prahlada" class="d">Prahl&#257;da</a> is damaging our name and fame. Because of his bad intelligence, he has become like a cinder in the dynasty of the demons. Now he needs to be treated by the fourth of the four kinds of political diplomacy.</div>

<div class="First">In political affairs, when a person disobediently agitates against the government, four principles are used to suppress him&mdash;legal orders, pacification, the offer of a post, or, finally, weapons. When there are no other arguments, he is punished. In logic, this is called <span class="Italic">argumentum ad baculum.</span> When the two seminal <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> &#7778;a&#7751;&#7693;a and Amarka failed to extract from <a href="/d/prahlada" class="d">Prahl&#257;da</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> the cause for his having opinions different from those of his father, they called for a stick with which to chastise him to satisfy their master, Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu. Because <a href="/d/prahlada" class="d">Prahl&#257;da</a> had become a devotee, they considered him to be contaminated by bad intelligence and to be the worst descendant in the family of demons. As it is said, where ignorance is bliss, it is folly to be wise. In a society or family in which everyone is a demon, for someone to become a <a href="/d/vaisnava" class="d">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava</a> is certainly folly. Thus <a href="/d/prahlada" class="d">Prahl&#257;da</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> was charged with bad intelligence because he was among demons, including his teachers, who were supposedly <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as.</span></div>
<A NAME="89277"></A><div id="89277"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The members of our <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness movement are in a position similar to that of <a href="/d/prahlada" class="d">Prahl&#257;da</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a>. All over the world, ninety-nine percent of the people are godless demons, and therefore our preaching of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness, following in the footsteps of <a href="/d/prahlada" class="d">Prahl&#257;da</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a>, is always hampered by many impediments. Because of their fault of being devotees, the American boys who have sacrificed everything for preaching <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness are charged with being members of the CIA. Moreover, the seminal <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> in India, who say that one can become a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> only if born in a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> family, charge us with ruining the <a href="/d/hindu" class="d">Hindu</a> system of religion. Of course, the fact is that one becomes a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> by qualification. Because we are training Europeans and Americans to become qualified and are awarding them brahminical status, we are being charged with destroying the <a href="/d/hindu" class="d">Hindu</a> religion. Nonetheless, confronting all kinds of difficulties, we must spread the <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness movement with great determination, like that of <a href="/d/prahlada" class="d">Prahl&#257;da</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a>. In spite of being the son of the demon Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, <a href="/d/prahlada" class="d">Prahl&#257;da</a> never feared the chastisements of the seminal <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> sons of a demoniac father.</div>
