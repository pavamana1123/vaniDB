One who has dedicated his life to the service of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> through these nine methods should be understood to be the most learned person, for he has acquired complete knowledge.</div>

This is the symptom of pure devotional service. A pure devotee is interested only in devotional service, not in material affairs.

When the dirt is cleansed from the <a href="/d/core" class="d">core</a> of one&rsquo;s heart, one can realize the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead&mdash;<span class="Italic"><a href="/d/isvarah" class="d">&#299;&#347;vara&#7717;</a> <a href="/d/paramah" class="d">parama&#7717;</a> <a href="/d/krsnah" class="d">k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&#7717;</a> sac-cid-<a href="/d/ananda" class="d">&#257;nanda</a>-<a href="/d/vigrahah" class="d">vigraha&#7717;</a> </I>[</I>Bs. </span>5.1</I>]<span class="Italic"></I>.</span> Thus by hearing the holy name of the Lord, one comes to the platform of understanding the personal form of the Lord. After realizing the Lord&rsquo;s form, one can realize the transcendental qualities of the Lord, and when one can understand His transcendental qualities one can understand the Lord&rsquo;s associates. In this way a devotee advances further and further toward complete understanding of the Lord as he awakens in realization of the Lord&rsquo;s holy name, transcendental form and qualities, His paraphernalia, and everything pertaining to Him. Therefore the chronological process is <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sravanam" class="d">&#347;rava&#7751;a&#7745;</a> <a href="/d/kirtanam" class="d">k&#299;rtana&#7745;</a> <a href="/d/visnoh" class="d">vi&#7779;&#7751;o&#7717;</a> </I>[SB </span></I><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/7/5/23-24?d=1">7.5.23</a>]<span class="Italic">.</span> This same process of chronological understanding holds true in chanting and remembering. When the chanting of the holy name, form, qualities and paraphernalia is heard from the mouth of a pure devotee, his hearing and chanting are very pleasing. &#346;r&#299;la <a href="/d/sanatana" class="d">San&#257;tana</a> Gosv&#257;m&#299; has forbidden us to hear the chanting of an artificial devotee or nondevotee.</div>

<div class="Purport">Hearing from the text of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a></span> is considered the most important process of hearing. <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a></span> is full of transcendental chanting of the holy name, and therefore the chanting and hearing of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a></span> are transcendentally full of mellows. The transcendental holy name of the Lord may be heard and chanted accordingly to the attraction of the devotee. One may chant the holy name of Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, or one may chant the holy name of Lord <a href="/d/rama" class="d">R&#257;ma</a> or N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva (<span class="Italic">r&#257;m&#257;di-<a href="/d/murtisu" class="d">m&#363;rti&#7779;u</a> <a href="/d/kala" class="d">kal&#257;</a>-<a href="/d/niyamena" class="d">niyamena</a> <a href="/d/tisthan" class="d">ti&#7779;&#7789;han</a></I> [Bs. </span></I>5.39]). The Lord has innumerable forms and names, and devotees may meditate upon a particular form and chant the holy name according to his attraction. The best course is to hear of the holy name, form and so on from a pure devotee of the same standard as oneself. In other words, one who is attached to <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> should chant and hear from other pure devotees who are also attached to Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. The same principle applies for devotees attracted by Lord <a href="/d/rama" class="d">R&#257;ma</a>, Lord <a href="/d/nrsimha" class="d">N&#7771;si&#7745;ha</a> and other forms of the Lord. Because <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is the ultimate form of the Lord (<span class="Italic">k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;as <a href="/d/tu" class="d">tu</a> <a href="/d/bhagavan" class="d">bhagav&#257;n</a> <a href="/d/svayam" class="d">svayam</a></span>), it is best to hear about Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s name, form and pastimes from a realized devotee who is particularly attracted by the form of Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. In <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a>,</span> great devotees like &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; have specifically described Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s holy name, form and qualities. Unless one hears about the holy name, form and qualities of the Lord, one cannot clearly understand the other processes of devotional service. Therefore &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/caitanya" class="d">Caitanya</a> <a href="/d/mahaprabhu" class="d">Mah&#257;prabhu</a> recommends that one chant the holy name of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/param" class="d">para&#7745;</a> <a href="/d/vijayate" class="d">vijayate</a> <a href="/d/sri" class="d">&#347;r&#299;</a>-<a href="/d/krsna" class="d">k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>-<a href="/d/sankirtanam" class="d">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtanam</a>.</span> If one is fortunate enough to hear from the mouth of realized devotees, he is very easily successful on the path of devotional service.

<div class="After-Verse">A devotee can very peacefully chant the holy name of the Lord by behaving more humbly than the grass, being tolerant like a tree and offering respects to everyone, without expecting honor from anyone else. Such qualifications make it easier to chant the holy name of the Lord. The process of transcendental chanting can be easily performed by anyone. Even if one is physically unfit, classified lower than others, devoid of material qualifications or not at all elevated in terms of pious activities, the chanting of the holy name is beneficial. An aristocratic birth, an advanced education, beautiful bodily features, wealth and similar results of pious activities are all unnecessary for advancement in spiritual life, for one can very easily advance simply by chanting the holy name. It is understood from the authoritative source of Vedic literature that especially in this age, <a href="/d/kali" class="d">Kali</a>-<a href="/d/yuga" class="d">yuga</a>, people are generally short-living, extremely bad in their habits, and inclined to accept methods of devotional service that are not bona fide.

Especially for householder devotees who are opulent in material possessions, the path of Deity worship is strongly recommended. An opulent householder devotee who does not engage his hard-earned money in the service of the Lord is called a miser. One should not engage paid <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> to worship the Deity. If one does not personally worship the Deity but engages paid servants instead, he is considered lazy, and his worship of the Deity is called artificial. An opulent householder can collect luxurious paraphernalia for Deity worship, and consequently for householder devotees the worship of the Deity is compulsory. In our <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness movement there are <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;s, g&#7771;hasthas, v&#257;naprasthas</span> and <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;s,</span> but the Deity worship in the temple should be performed especially by the householders. The <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;s</span> can go with the <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;s</span> to preach, and the <span class="Italic">v&#257;naprasthas</span> should prepare themselves for the next status of renounced life, <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sannyasa" class="d">sanny&#257;sa</a>.</span> <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/grhastha" class="d">G&#7771;hastha</a></span> devotees, however, are generally engaged in material activities, and therefore if they do not take to Deity worship, their falling down is positively assured. Deity worship means following the rules and regulations precisely. That will keep one steady in devotional service. Generally householders have children, and then the wives of the householders should be engaged in caring for the children, just as women acting as teachers care for the children in a nursery school.</div>

Regarding those unable to take to the Deity worship in the temple, there is the following statement in the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/agni" class="d">Agni</a> <a href="/d/purana" class="d">Pur&#257;&#7751;a</a>.</span> Any householder devotee circumstantially unable to worship the Deity must at least see the Deity worship, and in this way he may achieve success also. The special purpose of Deity worship is to keep oneself always pure and clean. <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/grhastha" class="d">G&#7771;hastha</a></span> devotees should be actual examples of cleanliness.</div>

By chanting the holy name of the Lord, one can reach the platform of love of Godhead. One might ask, then what is the necessity of being initiated?

While the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> was in pain, Lord <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a> in <a href="/d/vaikuntha" class="d">Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha</a> began smiling, and the goddess of fortune inquired from the Lord why He was smiling. Lord <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a> then ordered His associates to bring the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> to <a href="/d/vaikuntha" class="d">Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha</a>. Thus the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> attained the liberation of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/samipya" class="d">s&#257;m&#299;pya</a>,</span> the facility of living near the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="Purport">(6) <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/vandanam" class="d">Vandanam</a>.</span> Although prayers are a part of Deity worship, they may be considered separately like the other items, such as hearing and chanting, and therefore separate statements are given herewith. The Lord has unlimited transcendental qualities and opulences, and one who feels influenced by the Lord&rsquo;s qualities in various activities offers prayers to the Lord. In this way he becomes successful. In this connection, the following are some of the offenses to be avoided: (<span class="Italic">a</span>) to offer obeisances on one hand, (<span class="Italic">b</span>) to offer obeisances with one&rsquo;s body covered, (<span class="Italic">c</span>) to show one&rsquo;s back to the Deity, (<span class="Italic">d</span>) to offer obeisances on the left side of the Deity, (<span class="Italic">e</span>) to offer obeisances very near the Deity.</div>

<div class="Purport">(7) <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/dasyam" class="d">D&#257;syam</a>.</span> There is the following statement in regard to assisting the Lord as a servant. After many, many thousands of births, when one comes to understand that he is an eternal servant of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, one can deliver others from this universe. If one simply continues to think that he is an eternal servant of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, even without performing any other process of devotional service, he can attain full success, for simply by this feeling one can perform all nine processes of devotional service.</div>

<div class="Purport">(8) <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sakhyam" class="d">Sakhyam</a>.</span> In regard to worshiping the Lord as a friend, the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/agastya" class="d">Agastya</a>-<a href="/d/samhita" class="d">sa&#7745;hit&#257;</a></span> states that a devotee engaged in performing devotional service by <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sravanam" class="d">&#347;rava&#7751;am</a></span> and <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/kirtanam" class="d">k&#299;rtanam</a></span> sometimes wants to see the Lord personally, and for this purpose he resides in the temple. Elsewhere there is this statement: &ldquo;O my Lord, Supreme Personality and eternal friend, although You are full of bliss and knowledge, You have become the friend of the residents of <a href="/d/vrndavana" class="d">V&#7771;nd&#257;vana</a>. How fortunate are these devotees!&rdquo; In this statement the word &ldquo;friend&rdquo; is specifically used to indicate intense love. Friendship, therefore, is better than servitude. In the stage above <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/dasya" class="d">d&#257;sya</a>-<a href="/d/rasa" class="d">rasa</a>,</span> the devotee accepts the Supreme Personality of Godhead as a friend. This is not at all astonishing, for when a devotee is pure in heart the opulence of his worship of the Deity diminishes as spontaneous love for the Personality of Godhead is manifested. In this regard, &#346;r&#299;dhara <a href="/d/svami" class="d">Sv&#257;m&#299;</a> mentions &#346;r&#299;d&#257;ma <a href="/d/vipra" class="d">Vipra</a>, who expressed to himself his feelings of obligation, thinking, &ldquo;Life after life, may I be connected with <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> in this friendly attitude.&rdquo;</div>

<div class="Purport">(9) <span class="Italic">&#256;tma-<a href="/d/nivedanam" class="d">nivedanam</a>.</span> The word <span class="Italic">&#256;tma-<a href="/d/nivedanam" class="d">nivedanam</a></span> refers to the stage at which one who has no motive other than to serve the Lord surrenders everything to the Lord and performs his activities only to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such a devotee is like a cow that is cared for by its master. When cared for by its master, a cow is not in anxiety over its maintenance. Such a cow is always devoted to its master, and it never acts independently, but only for the master&rsquo;s benefit. Some devotees, therefore, consider dedication of the body to the Lord to be <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/atma" class="d">&#257;tma</a>-<a href="/d/nivedanam" class="d">nivedanam</a>,</span> and as stated in the book known as <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">Bhakti</a>-<a href="/d/viveka" class="d">viveka</a>,</span> sometimes dedication of the soul to the Lord is called <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/atma" class="d">&#257;tma</a>-<a href="/d/nivedanam" class="d">nivedanam</a>.</span> The best examples of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/atma" class="d">&#257;tma</a>-<a href="/d/nivedanam" class="d">nivedanam</a></span> are found in <a href="/d/bali" class="d">Bali</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> and <a href="/d/ambarisa" class="d">Ambar&#299;&#7779;a</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a>. <span class="Italic">&#256;tma-<a href="/d/nivedanam" class="d">nivedanam</a></span> is also sometimes found in the behavior of Rukmi&#7751;&#299;dev&#299; at <a href="/d/dvaraka" class="d">Dv&#257;rak&#257;</a>.</div>
