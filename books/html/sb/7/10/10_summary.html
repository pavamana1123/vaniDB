<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">This chapter describes how the Supreme Personality of Godhead N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva disappeared, after pleasing <a href="/d/prahlada" class="d">Prahl&#257;da</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a>. It also describes a benediction given by Lord &#346;iva.</div>
</div><A NAME="92739"></A><div id="92739"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Lord N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva wanted to bestow benedictions upon <a href="/d/prahlada" class="d">Prahl&#257;da</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a>, one after another, but <a href="/d/prahlada" class="d">Prahl&#257;da</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a>, thinking them impediments on the path of spiritual progress, did not accept any of them. Instead, he fully surrendered at the Lord&rsquo;s lotus feet. He said: &ldquo;If anyone engaged in the devotional service of the Lord prays for personal sense gratification, he cannot be called a pure devotee or even a devotee. He may be called only a merchant engaged in the business of give and take. Similarly, a master who wants to please his servant after taking service from him is also not a real master.&rdquo; <a href="/d/prahlada" class="d">Prahl&#257;da</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a>, therefore, did not ask anything from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Rather, he said that if the Lord wanted to give him a benediction, he wanted the Lord to assure him that he would never be induced to take any benedictions for the sake of material desires. Exchanges of devotional service for lusty desires are always very prominent. As soon as lusty desires awaken, one&rsquo;s senses, mind, life, soul, religious principles, patience, intelligence, shyness, beauty, strength, memory and truthfulness are all vanquished. One can render unalloyed devotional service only when there are no material desires in one&rsquo;s mind.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">The Supreme Personality of Godhead was greatly pleased with <a href="/d/prahlada" class="d">Prahl&#257;da</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> for his unalloyed devotion, yet the Lord provided him one material benediction&mdash;that he would be perfectly happy in this world and live his next life in <a href="/d/vaikuntha" class="d">Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha</a>. The Lord gave him the benediction that he would be the king of this material world until the end of the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/manvantara" class="d">manvantara</a></span> millennium and that although in this material world, he would have the facility to hear the glories of the Lord and depend fully on the Lord, performing service to Him in uncontaminated <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">bhakti</a>-<a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a>.</span> The Lord advised <a href="/d/prahlada" class="d">Prahl&#257;da</a> to perform sacrifices through <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">bhakti</a>-<a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a>,</span> for this is the duty of a king.</div>
</div><A NAME="92741"></A><div id="92741"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level"><a href="/d/prahlada" class="d">Prahl&#257;da</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> accepted whatever the Lord had offered him, and he prayed for the Lord to deliver his father. In response to this prayer, the Lord assured him that in the family of such a pure devotee as he, not only the devotee&rsquo;s father but his forefathers for twenty-one generations are liberated. The Lord also asked <a href="/d/prahlada" class="d">Prahl&#257;da</a> to perform the ritualistic ceremonies appropriate after his father&rsquo;s death.</div>
</div><A NAME="92742"></A><div id="92742"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Then Lord <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a>, who was also present, offered many prayers to the Lord, expressing his obligation to the Lord for having offered benedictions to <a href="/d/prahlada" class="d">Prahl&#257;da</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a>. The Lord advised Lord <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> not to offer benedictions to <span class="Italic">asuras</span> as he had to Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, for such benedictions indulge them. Then Lord N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva disappeared. On that day, <a href="/d/prahlada" class="d">Prahl&#257;da</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> was installed on the throne of the world by Lord <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> and &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Thus <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> described the character of <a href="/d/prahlada" class="d">Prahl&#257;da</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> for <a href="/d/yudhisthira" class="d">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a>, and he further described the killing of <a href="/d/ravana" class="d">R&#257;va&#7751;a</a> by Lord <a href="/d/ramacandra" class="d">R&#257;macandra</a> and the killing of &#346;i&#347;up&#257;la and <a href="/d/dantavakra" class="d">Dantavakra</a> in <a href="/d/dvapara" class="d">Dv&#257;para</a>-<a href="/d/yuga" class="d">yuga</a>. &#346;i&#347;up&#257;la, of course, had merged into the existence of the Lord and thus achieved <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sayujya" class="d">s&#257;yujya</a>-<a href="/d/mukti" class="d">mukti</a>.</span> <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> praised <a href="/d/yudhisthira" class="d">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> because the Supreme Lord, <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, was the greatest well-wisher and friend of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas and almost always stayed in their house. Thus the fortune of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas was greater than that of <a href="/d/prahlada" class="d">Prahl&#257;da</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a>.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level"><TB>Later, <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> described how the demon <a href="/d/maya" class="d">Maya</a> <a href="/d/danava" class="d">D&#257;nava</a> constructed <a href="/d/tripura" class="d">Tripura</a> for the demons, who became very powerful and defeated the demigods. Because of this defeat, Lord <a href="/d/rudra" class="d">Rudra</a>, &#346;iva, dismantled <a href="/d/tripura" class="d">Tripura</a>; thus he became famous as Tripur&#257;ri. For this, <a href="/d/rudra" class="d">Rudra</a> is very much appreciated and worshiped by the demigods. This narration occurs at the end of the chapter.</div>
