<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">This chapter fully describes how Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu obtained power from Lord <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> and misused it by harassing all the living entities within this universe.</div>
</div><A NAME="88434"></A><div id="88434"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">By severe austerities, Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu satisfied Lord <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> and obtained the benedictions he desired. After he received these benedictions, his body, which had been almost entirely consumed, was revived with full beauty and a luster like gold. Nonetheless, he continued to be envious of Lord <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a>, unable to forget Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u&rsquo;s having killed his brother. Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu conquered everyone in the ten directions and the three worlds and brought all living entities, both demigods and <span class="Italic">asuras,</span> under his control. Becoming the master of all places, including the residence of <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a>, whom he had driven out, he began enjoying life in great luxury and thus became <a href="/d/mad" class="d">mad</a>. All the demigods but Lord <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a>, Lord <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> and Lord &#346;iva came under his control and began serving him, but despite all his material power he was dissatisfied because he was always puffed up, proud of transgressing the Vedic regulations. All the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> were dissatisfied with him, and they cursed him with determination. Eventually, all the living entities within the universe, represented by the demigods and sages, prayed to the Supreme Lord for relief from Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu&rsquo;s rule.</div>
</div><A NAME="88435"></A><div id="88435"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Lord <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a> informed the demigods that they and the other living entities would be saved from the fearful conditions created by Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu. Since Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu was the oppressor of all the demigods, the followers of the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> the cows, the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and the religious, saintly persons, and since he was envious of the Supreme Lord, he would naturally be killed very soon. Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu&rsquo;s last exploit would be to torment his own son <a href="/d/prahlada" class="d">Prahl&#257;da</a>, who was a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/maha" class="d">mah&#257;</a>-<a href="/d/bhagavata" class="d">bh&#257;gavata</a>,</span> an exalted <a href="/d/vaisnava" class="d">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava</a>. Then his life would end. When the demigods were thus reassured by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, everyone was satisfied, knowing that the miseries inflicted upon them by Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu would come to an end.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Finally, <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> describes the characteristics of <a href="/d/prahlada" class="d">Prahl&#257;da</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a>, the son of Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, and describes how his father envied his own qualified son. In this way the chapter ends.</div>
