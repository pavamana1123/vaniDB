<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">The <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmacari" class="d">brahmac&#257;ri</a></span> should live under the care of the true spiritual master, giving him sincere respect and obeisances, acting as his menial servant, and always carrying out his order. The <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmacari" class="d">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</a></span> should engage himself in spiritual activities and study the Vedic literature under the direction of the spiritual master. According to the <span class="Italic">brahmacarya</span> system, he should dress with a belt, deerskin, and matted hair and should bear a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/danda" class="d">da&#7751;&#7693;a</a>,</span> waterpot and sacred thread. He should collect alms daily in the morning, and in the evening whatever alms he has collected he should offer to the spiritual master. A <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmacari" class="d">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</a></span> should accept <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/prasada" class="d">pras&#257;da</a></span> upon the order of the spiritual master, and if the spiritual master sometimes forgets to order the disciple to eat, the disciple should not take <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/prasada" class="d">pras&#257;da</a></span> on his own initiative; rather, he should fast. The <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmacari" class="d">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</a></span> should be trained to be satisfied with eating what is absolutely necessary, he should be very expert in executing responsibilities, he should be faithful, and he should control his senses and try to avoid the association of women as far as possible. A <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmacari" class="d">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</a></span> should very strictly abstain from living with women and should not meet with <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hasthas</span> and those too addicted to women. Nor should a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmacari" class="d">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</a></span> speak in a lonely place with a woman.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">After completing one&rsquo;s education as a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmacari" class="d">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</a></span> in this way, one should give <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/daksina" class="d">dak&#7779;i&#7751;&#257;</a>,</span> an offering of gratitude, to one&rsquo;s <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/guru" class="d">guru</a>,</span> and then one may leave for home and accept the next <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/asrama" class="d">&#257;&#347;rama</a></span>&mdash;the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/grhastha" class="d">g&#7771;hastha</a>-<a href="/d/asrama" class="d">&#257;&#347;rama</a></span>&mdash;or else one may continue in the <span class="Italic">brahmacarya-<a href="/d/asrama" class="d">&#257;&#347;rama</a></span> without adulteration. The duties for the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/grhastha" class="d">g&#7771;hastha</a>-<a href="/d/asrama" class="d">&#257;&#347;rama</a></span> and <span class="Italic">brahmacarya-<a href="/d/asrama" class="d">&#257;&#347;rama</a>,</span> as well as the duties for <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;s,</span> are prescribed in the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras.</span> A <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/grhastha" class="d">g&#7771;hastha</a></span> is not meant to enjoy sex life without restriction. Indeed, the whole purpose of Vedic life is to become free from sexual indulgence. All the <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;ramas</span> are recognized for spiritual progress, and therefore although the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/grhastha" class="d">g&#7771;hastha</a>-<a href="/d/asrama" class="d">&#257;&#347;rama</a></span> gives a kind of license for sex life for a certain time, it does not allow unrestricted sex life. Therefore, in <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/grhastha" class="d">g&#7771;hastha</a></span> life also, there is no illicit sex. A <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/grhastha" class="d">g&#7771;hastha</a></span> should not accept a woman for sexual enjoyment. Wasting semen is also illicit sex.</div>

Nor should he cook food with fire, although he is allowed to eat <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/caru" class="d">caru</a>,</span> grains that have been offered in a sacrificial fire. He may also eat fruits and grains that have grown naturally. Living in a thatched cottage, the <span class="Italic">v&#257;naprastha</span> should endure all kinds of heat and cold. He should not cut his nails or hair, and he should give up cleaning his body and teeth. He should wear tree bark, accept a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/danda" class="d">da&#7751;&#7693;a</a>,</span> and practice life in the forest, taking a vow to live there for twelve years, eight years, four years, two years or at least one year. At last, when because of old age he can no longer perform the activities of a <span class="Italic">v&#257;naprastha,</span> he should gradually stop everything and in this way give up his body.</div>
