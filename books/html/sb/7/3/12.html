<div class="Translation">O lord, we have heard from reliable sources that in order to obtain your post, Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu is now engaged in severe austerity. You are the master of the three worlds. Please, without delay, take whatever steps you deem appropriate.</div>

<div class="First">In the material world, a servant is provided for by the master but is always planning how to capture the master&rsquo;s post. There have been many instances of this in history. Especially in India during the Mohammedan rule, many servants, by plans and devices, took over the posts of their masters. It is learned from <a href="/d/caitanya" class="d">Caitanya</a> literature that one big Zamindar, <a href="/d/subuddhi" class="d">Subuddhi</a> <a href="/d/raya" class="d">R&#257;ya</a>, kept a Mohammedan boy as a servant. Of course, he treated the boy as his own child, and sometimes, when the boy would steal something, the master would chastise him by striking him with a cane. There was a mark on the boy&rsquo;s back from this chastisement. Later, after that boy had by crooked means become Hussain Shah, Nawab of Bengal, one day his wife saw the mark on his back and inquired about it. The Nawab replied that in his childhood he had been a servant of <a href="/d/subuddhi" class="d">Subuddhi</a> <a href="/d/raya" class="d">R&#257;ya</a>, who had punished him because of some mischievous activities. Upon hearing this, the Nawab&rsquo;s wife immediately became agitated and requested her husband to kill <a href="/d/subuddhi" class="d">Subuddhi</a> <a href="/d/raya" class="d">R&#257;ya</a>. Nawab Hussain Shah, of course, was very grateful to <a href="/d/subuddhi" class="d">Subuddhi</a> <a href="/d/raya" class="d">R&#257;ya</a> and therefore refused to kill him, but when his wife requested him to turn <a href="/d/subuddhi" class="d">Subuddhi</a> <a href="/d/raya" class="d">R&#257;ya</a> into a Mohammedan, the Nawab agreed. Taking some water from his waterpot, he sprinkled it upon <a href="/d/subuddhi" class="d">Subuddhi</a> <a href="/d/raya" class="d">R&#257;ya</a> and declared that <a href="/d/subuddhi" class="d">Subuddhi</a> <a href="/d/raya" class="d">R&#257;ya</a> had now become a Mohammedan. The point is that this Nawab had been an ordinary menial servant of <a href="/d/subuddhi" class="d">Subuddhi</a> <a href="/d/raya" class="d">R&#257;ya</a> but was somehow or other able to occupy the supreme post of Nawab of Bengal. This is the material world. Everyone is trying to become master through various devices, although everyone is servant of his senses. Following this system, a living entity, although servant of his senses, tries to become master of the whole universe. Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu was a typical example of this, and <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> was informed by the demigods of his intentions.</div>
