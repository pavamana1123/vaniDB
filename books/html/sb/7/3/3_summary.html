<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">This chapter describes how Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu performed a severe type of austerity for material benefit, thus causing great distress throughout the universe. Even Lord <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a>, the chief personality within this universe, became somewhat disturbed and personally went to see why Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu was engaged in such a severe austerity.</div>
</div><A NAME="87924"></A><div id="87924"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu wanted to become immortal. He wanted not to be conquered by anyone, not to be attacked by old age and disease, and not to be harassed by any opponent. Thus he wanted to become the absolute ruler of the entire universe. With this desire, he entered the valley of <a href="/d/mandara" class="d">Mandara</a> Mountain and began practicing a severe type of austerity and meditation. Seeing Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu engaged in this austerity, the demigods returned to their respective homes, but while Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu was thus engaged, a kind of fire began blazing from his head, disturbing the entire universe and its inhabitants, including the birds, beasts and demigods. When all the higher and lower planets became too hot to live on, the demigods, being disturbed, left their abodes in the higher planets and went to see Lord <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a>, praying to him that he curtail this unnecessary heat. The demigods disclosed to Lord <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu&rsquo;s ambition to become immortal, overcoming his short duration of life, and to be the master of all the planetary systems, even Dhruvaloka.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Upon hearing about the purpose of Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu&rsquo;s austere meditation, Lord <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a>, accompanied by the great sage <a href="/d/bhrgu" class="d">Bh&#7771;gu</a> and great personalities like <a href="/d/daksa" class="d">Dak&#7779;a</a>, went to see Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu. He then sprinkled water from his <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/kamandalu" class="d">kama&#7751;&#7693;alu</a>,</span> a type of waterpot, upon Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu&rsquo;s head.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, the King of the Daityas, bowed down before Lord <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a>, the creator of this universe, offering respectful obeisances again and again and offering prayers. When Lord <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> agreed to give him benedictions, he prayed not be killed by any living entity, not to be killed in any place, covered or uncovered, not to die in the daytime or at night, not to be killed by any weapon, on land or in the air, and not to be killed by any human being, animal, demigod or any other entity, living or nonliving. He further prayed for supremacy over the entire universe and requested the eight yogic perfections, such as <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/anima" class="d">a&#7751;im&#257;</a></span> and <span class="Italic">laghim&#257;.</span></div>
