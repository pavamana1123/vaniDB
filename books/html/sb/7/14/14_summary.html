<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">This chapter describes the occupational duties of the householder according to the time, the country and the performer. When <a href="/d/yudhisthira" class="d">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> became very much inquisitive about the occupational duties for the householder, <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> advised him that a <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha&rsquo;s</span> first duty is to be fully dependent on <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">V&#257;sudeva</a>, <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, and to try to satisfy Him in all respects by executing one&rsquo;s prescribed devotional service. This devotional service will depend on the instructions of authorities and the association of devotees who are actually engaged in devotional service. The beginning of devotional service is <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sravanam" class="d">&#347;rava&#7751;am</a>,</span> or hearing. One must hear from the mouths of realized souls. In this way the <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha&rsquo;s</span> attraction to his wife and children will gradually be reduced.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">As for the maintenance of his family, a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/grhastha" class="d">g&#7771;hastha</a>,</span> while earning what he requires for his living, must be very conscientious and must not undergo extraordinary endeavor simply to accumulate money and unnecessarily increase in material comforts. Although a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/grhastha" class="d">g&#7771;hastha</a></span> should externally be very active in earning his livelihood, he should internally be situated as a fully self-realized person, without attachment for material gains. His dealings with family members or friends should be performed simply to fulfill their purpose; one should not be extravagantly engaged in this way. Instructions from family members and society should be accepted superficially, but in essence the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/grhastha" class="d">g&#7771;hastha</a></span> should be engaged in occupational duties advised by the spiritual master and <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sastra" class="d">&#347;&#257;stra</a>.</span> Specifically a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/grhastha" class="d">g&#7771;hastha</a></span> should engage in agricultural activities to earn money. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a> </span>(<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/18/44?d=1">18.44</a>), <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/krsi" class="d">k&#7771;&#7779;i</a>-go-<a href="/d/raksya" class="d">rak&#7779;ya</a>-<a href="/d/vanijyam" class="d">v&#257;&#7751;ijyam</a></span>&mdash;agriculture, cow protection and trade&mdash;are special duties of <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hasthas.</span> If by chance or by the grace of the Lord more money comes, it should be properly engaged for the <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness movement. One should not be eager to earn more money simply for sensual pleasure. A <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/grhastha" class="d">g&#7771;hastha</a></span> should always remember that one who is endeavoring to accumulate more money than necessary is to be considered a thief and is punishable by the laws of nature.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">A <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/grhastha" class="d">g&#7771;hastha</a></span> should be very much affectionate toward lower animals, birds and bees, treating them exactly like his own children. A <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/grhastha" class="d">g&#7771;hastha</a></span> should not indulge in killing animals or birds for sense gratification. He should provide the necessities of life even to the dogs and the lowest creatures and should not exploit others for sense gratification. Factually, according to the instructions of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a>,</span> every <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/grhastha" class="d">g&#7771;hastha</a></span> is a great communist who provides the means of living for everyone. Whatever a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/grhastha" class="d">g&#7771;hastha</a></span> may possess he should equally distribute to all living entities, without discrimination. The best process is to distribute <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/prasada" class="d">pras&#257;da</a>.</span></div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">A <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/grhastha" class="d">g&#7771;hastha</a></span> should not be very much attached to his wife; he should engage even his own wife in serving a guest with all attention. Whatever money a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/grhastha" class="d">g&#7771;hastha</a></span> accumulates by the grace of God he should spend in five activities, namely worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead, receiving Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas and saintly persons, distributing <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/prasada" class="d">pras&#257;da</a></span> to the general public and to all living entities, offering <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/prasada" class="d">pras&#257;da</a></span> to his forefathers, and also offering <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/prasada" class="d">pras&#257;da</a></span> to his own self. <span class="Italic">G&#7771;hasthas</span> should always be ready to worship everyone as mentioned above. The <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/grhastha" class="d">g&#7771;hastha</a></span> should not eat anything not offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As it is said in the <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/3/13?d=1">3.13</a>), <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yajna" class="d">yaj&ntilde;a</a>-&#347;i&#7779;&#7789;&#257;&#347;ina&#7717; santo <a href="/d/mucyante" class="d">mucyante</a> <a href="/d/sarva" class="d">sarva</a>-<a href="/d/kilbisaih" class="d">kilbi&#7779;ai&#7717;</a>:</span> &ldquo;The devotees of the Lord are released from all kinds of sins because they eat food that is offered first for sacrifice.&rdquo; The <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/grhastha" class="d">g&#7771;hastha</a></span> should also visit the holy places of pilgrimage mentioned in the <span class="Italic">pur&#257;&#7751;as.</span> In this way he should fully engage in worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead for the benefit of his family, his society, his country, and humanity at large.</div>
