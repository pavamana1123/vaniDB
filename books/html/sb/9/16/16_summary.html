<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">When Jamadagni was killed by the sons of K&#257;rtav&#299;ry&#257;rjuna, as described in this chapter, <a href="/d/parasurama" class="d">Para&#347;ur&#257;ma</a> rid the entire world of <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas</span> twenty-one times. This chapter also describes the descendants of <a href="/d/visvamitra" class="d">Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra</a>.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">When Jamadagni&rsquo;s wife, <a href="/d/renuka" class="d">Re&#7751;uk&#257;</a>, went to bring water from the Ganges and saw the King of the Gandharvas enjoying the company of Apsar&#257;s, she was captivated, and she slightly desired to associate with him. Because of this sinful desire, she was punished by her husband. <a href="/d/parasurama" class="d">Para&#347;ur&#257;ma</a> killed his mother and brothers, but later, by dint of the austerities of Jamadagni, they were revived. The sons of K&#257;rtav&#299;ry&#257;rjuna, however, remembering the death of their father, wanted to take revenge against Lord <a href="/d/parasurama" class="d">Para&#347;ur&#257;ma</a>, and therefore when <a href="/d/parasurama" class="d">Para&#347;ur&#257;ma</a> was absent from the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/asrama" class="d">&#257;&#347;rama</a>,</span> they killed Jamadagni, who was meditating on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When <a href="/d/parasurama" class="d">Para&#347;ur&#257;ma</a> returned to the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/asrama" class="d">&#257;&#347;rama</a></span> and saw his father killed, he was very sorry, and after asking his brothers to take care of the dead body, he went out with determination to kill all the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas</span> on the surface of the world. Taking up his axe, he went to <a href="/d/mahismati" class="d">M&#257;hi&#7779;mat&#299;</a>-<a href="/d/pura" class="d">pura</a>, the capital of K&#257;rtav&#299;ry&#257;rjuna, and killed all of K&#257;rtav&#299;ry&#257;rjuna&rsquo;s sons, whose blood became a great river. <a href="/d/parasurama" class="d">Para&#347;ur&#257;ma</a>, however, was not satisfied with killing only the sons of K&#257;rtav&#299;ry&#257;rjuna; later, when the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas</span> became disturbing, he killed them twenty-one times, so that there were no <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas</span> on the surface of the earth. Thereafter, <a href="/d/parasurama" class="d">Para&#347;ur&#257;ma</a> joined the head of his father to the dead body and performed various sacrifices to please the Supreme Lord. Thus Jamadagni got life again in his body, and later he was promoted to the higher planetary system known as Saptar&#7779;i-<a href="/d/mandala" class="d">ma&#7751;&#7693;ala</a>. <a href="/d/parasurama" class="d">Para&#347;ur&#257;ma</a>, the son of Jamadagni, still lives in <a href="/d/mahendra" class="d">Mahendra</a>-<a href="/d/parvata" class="d">parvata</a>. In the next <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/manvantara" class="d">manvantara</a>,</span> he will become a preacher of Vedic knowledge.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">In the dynasty of <a href="/d/gadhi" class="d">G&#257;dhi</a>, the most powerful <a href="/d/visvamitra" class="d">Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra</a> took birth. By dint of his austerity and penance, he became a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a>.</span> He had 101 sons, who were celebrated as the Madhucchand&#257;s. In the sacrificial arena of <a href="/d/hariscandra" class="d">Hari&#347;candra</a>, the son of Aj&#299;garta named &#346;una&#7717;&#347;epha was meant to be sacrificed, but by the mercy of the Praj&#257;patis he was released. Thereafter, he became Devar&#257;ta in the dynasty of <a href="/d/gadhi" class="d">G&#257;dhi</a>. The fifty elder sons of <a href="/d/visvamitra" class="d">Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra</a>, however, did not accept &#346;una&#7717;&#347;epha as their elder brother, and therefore <a href="/d/visvamitra" class="d">Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra</a> cursed them to become <span class="Italic">mlecchas,</span> unfaithful to the Vedic civilization. Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra&rsquo;s fifty-first son, along with his younger brothers, then accepted &#346;una&#7717;&#347;epha as their eldest brother, and their father, <a href="/d/visvamitra" class="d">Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra</a>, being satisfied, blessed them. Thus Devar&#257;ta was accepted in the dynasty of <a href="/d/kausika" class="d">Kau&#347;ika</a>, and consequently there are different divisions of that dynasty.</div>
