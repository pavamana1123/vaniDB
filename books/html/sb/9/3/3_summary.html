<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">This chapter describes the dynasty of &#346;ary&#257;ti, another son of <a href="/d/manu" class="d">Manu</a>, and also tells about <a href="/d/sukanya" class="d">Sukany&#257;</a> and <a href="/d/revati" class="d">Revat&#299;</a>.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Devaj&ntilde;a &#346;ary&#257;ti gave instructions about what to do in the ritualistic ceremony observed on the second day of the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yajna" class="d">yaj&ntilde;a</a></span> of the A&#7749;girasas. One day, &#346;ary&#257;ti, along with his daughter, known as <a href="/d/sukanya" class="d">Sukany&#257;</a>, went to the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/asrama" class="d">&#257;&#347;rama</a></span> of <a href="/d/cyavana" class="d">Cyavana</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a>. There <a href="/d/sukanya" class="d">Sukany&#257;</a> saw two glowing substances within a hole of earthworms, and by chance she pierced those two glowing substances. As soon as she did this, blood began to ooze from that hole. Consequently, King &#346;ary&#257;ti and his companions suffered from constipation and inability to pass urine. When the King asked why circumstances had suddenly changed, he found that <a href="/d/sukanya" class="d">Sukany&#257;</a> was the cause of this misfortune. Then they all offered prayers to <a href="/d/cyavana" class="d">Cyavana</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> just to satisfy him according to his own desire, and Devaj&ntilde;a &#346;ary&#257;ti offered his daughter to <a href="/d/cyavana" class="d">Cyavana</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a>, who was a very old man.</div>

<div class="Normal-Level">When the heavenly physicians the A&#347;vin&#299;-<a href="/d/kumara" class="d">kum&#257;ra</a> brothers once visited <a href="/d/cyavana" class="d">Cyavana</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a>, the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/muni" class="d">muni</a></span> requested them to give him back his youth. These two physicians took <a href="/d/cyavana" class="d">Cyavana</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> to a particular lake, in which they bathed and regained full youth. After this, <a href="/d/sukanya" class="d">Sukany&#257;</a> could not distinguish her husband. She then surrendered unto the A&#347;vin&#299;-kum&#257;ras, who were very satisfied with her chastity and who therefore introduced her again to her husband. <a href="/d/cyavana" class="d">Cyavana</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> then engaged King &#346;ary&#257;ti in performing the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/soma" class="d">soma</a>-<a href="/d/yajna" class="d">yaj&ntilde;a</a></span> and gave the A&#347;vin&#299;-kum&#257;ras the privilege to drink <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/soma" class="d">soma</a>-<a href="/d/rasa" class="d">rasa</a>.</span> The King of heaven, Lord <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a>, became very angry at this, but he could do no harm to &#346;ary&#257;ti. Henceforward, the A&#347;vin&#299;-<a href="/d/kumara" class="d">kum&#257;ra</a> physicians were able to share in the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/soma" class="d">soma</a>-<a href="/d/rasa" class="d">rasa</a>.</span></div>

<div class="Normal-Level">&#346;ary&#257;ti later had three sons, named Utt&#257;nabarhi, &#256;narta and <a href="/d/bhurisena" class="d">Bh&#363;ri&#7779;e&#7751;a</a>. &#256;narta had one son, whose name was Revata. Revata had one hundred sons, of whom the eldest was <a href="/d/kakudmi" class="d">Kakudm&#299;</a>. <a href="/d/kakudmi" class="d">Kakudm&#299;</a> was advised by Lord <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> to offer his beautiful daughter, <a href="/d/revati" class="d">Revat&#299;</a>, to <a href="/d/baladeva" class="d">Baladeva</a>, who belongs to the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/visnu" class="d">vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a>-<a href="/d/tattva" class="d">tattva</a></span> category. After doing this, <a href="/d/kakudmi" class="d">Kakudm&#299;</a> retired from family life and entered the forest of Badarik&#257;&#347;rama to execute austerities and penances.</div>
