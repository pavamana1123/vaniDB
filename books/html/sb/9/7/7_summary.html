<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">In this chapter the descendants of King <a href="/d/mandhata" class="d">M&#257;ndh&#257;t&#257;</a> are described, and in this connection the histories of Purukutsa and <a href="/d/hariscandra" class="d">Hari&#347;candra</a> are also given.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">The most prominent son of <a href="/d/mandhata" class="d">M&#257;ndh&#257;t&#257;</a> was <a href="/d/ambarisa" class="d">Ambar&#299;&#7779;a</a>, his son was Yauvan&#257;&#347;va, and Yauvan&#257;&#347;va&rsquo;s son was <a href="/d/harita" class="d">H&#257;r&#299;ta</a>. These three personalities were the best in the dynasty of <a href="/d/mandhata" class="d">M&#257;ndh&#257;t&#257;</a>. Purukutsa, another son of <a href="/d/mandhata" class="d">M&#257;ndh&#257;t&#257;</a>, married the sister of the snakes (<span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sarpa" class="d">sarpa</a>-<a href="/d/gana" class="d">ga&#7751;a</a></span>) named <a href="/d/narmada" class="d">Narmad&#257;</a>. The son of Purukutsa was Trasaddasyu, whose son was Anara&#7751;ya. Anara&#7751;ya&rsquo;s son was <a href="/d/haryasva" class="d">Harya&#347;va</a>, Harya&#347;va&rsquo;s son was Pr&#257;ru&#7751;a, Pr&#257;ru&#7751;a&rsquo;s son was Tribandhana, and Tribandhana&rsquo;s son was Satyavrata, also known as Tri&#347;a&#7749;ku. When Tri&#347;a&#7749;ku kidnapped the daughter of a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a>,</span> his father cursed him for this sinful act, and Tri&#347;a&#7749;ku became a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/candala" class="d">ca&#7751;&#7693;&#257;la</a>,</span> worse than a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sudra" class="d">&#347;&#363;dra</a>.</span> Later, by the influence of <a href="/d/visvamitra" class="d">Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra</a>, he was brought to the heavenly planets, but by the influence of the demigods he fell back downward. He was stopped in his fall, however, by the influence of <a href="/d/visvamitra" class="d">Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra</a>. The son of Tri&#347;a&#7749;ku was <a href="/d/hariscandra" class="d">Hari&#347;candra</a>. <a href="/d/hariscandra" class="d">Hari&#347;candra</a> once performed a <a href="/d/rajasuya" class="d">R&#257;jas&#363;ya</a>-<a href="/d/yajna" class="d">yaj&ntilde;a</a>, but <a href="/d/visvamitra" class="d">Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra</a> cunningly took all of Hari&#347;candra&rsquo;s possessions as a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/daksina" class="d">dak&#7779;i&#7751;a</a></span> contribution and chastised <a href="/d/hariscandra" class="d">Hari&#347;candra</a> in various ways. Because of this, a quarrel arose between <a href="/d/visvamitra" class="d">Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra</a> and <a href="/d/vasistha" class="d">Vasi&#7779;&#7789;ha</a>. <a href="/d/hariscandra" class="d">Hari&#347;candra</a> had no sons, but on the advice of <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> he worshiped <a href="/d/varuna" class="d">Varu&#7751;a</a> and in this way got a son named <a href="/d/rohita" class="d">Rohita</a>. <a href="/d/hariscandra" class="d">Hari&#347;candra</a> promised that <a href="/d/rohita" class="d">Rohita</a> would be used to perform a <a href="/d/varuna" class="d">Varu&#7751;a</a>-<a href="/d/yajna" class="d">yaj&ntilde;a</a>. <a href="/d/varuna" class="d">Varu&#7751;a</a> reminded <a href="/d/hariscandra" class="d">Hari&#347;candra</a> repeatedly about this <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yajna" class="d">yaj&ntilde;a</a>,</span> but the King, because of affection for his son, gave various arguments to avoid sacrificing him. Thus time passed, and gradually the son grew up. To safeguard his life, the boy then took bow and arrows in hand and went to the forest. Meanwhile, at home, <a href="/d/hariscandra" class="d">Hari&#347;candra</a> suffered from dropsy because of an attack from <a href="/d/varuna" class="d">Varu&#7751;a</a>. When <a href="/d/rohita" class="d">Rohita</a> received the news that his father was suffering, he wanted to return to the capital, but King <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a> prevented him from doing so. Following the instructions of <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a>, <a href="/d/rohita" class="d">Rohita</a> lived in the forest for six years and then returned home. <a href="/d/rohita" class="d">Rohita</a> purchased &#346;una&#7717;&#347;epha, the second son of Aj&#299;garta, and gave him to his father, <a href="/d/hariscandra" class="d">Hari&#347;candra</a>, as the sacrificial animal. In this way, the sacrifice was performed, <a href="/d/varuna" class="d">Varu&#7751;a</a> and the other demigods were pacified, and <a href="/d/hariscandra" class="d">Hari&#347;candra</a> was freed from disease. In this sacrifice, <a href="/d/visvamitra" class="d">Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra</a> was the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/hota" class="d">hot&#257;</a></span> priest, Jamadagni was the <span class="Italic">adhvaryu,</span> <a href="/d/vasistha" class="d">Vasi&#7779;&#7789;ha</a> was the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahma" class="d">brahm&#257;</a>,</span> and Ay&#257;sya was the <span class="Italic">udg&#257;t&#257;.</span> King <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a>, being very satisfied by the sacrifice, gave <a href="/d/hariscandra" class="d">Hari&#347;candra</a> a golden chariot, and <a href="/d/visvamitra" class="d">Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra</a> gave him transcendental knowledge. Thus &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; describes how <a href="/d/hariscandra" class="d">Hari&#347;candra</a> achieved perfection.</div>
