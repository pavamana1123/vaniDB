<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">This Second Chapter describes the dynasties of the sons of <a href="/d/manu" class="d">Manu</a>, headed by <a href="/d/karusa" class="d">Kar&#363;&#7779;a</a>.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">After <a href="/d/sudyumna" class="d">Sudyumna</a> accepted the order of <span class="Italic">v&#257;naprastha</span> and departed for the forest, <a href="/d/vaivasvata" class="d">Vaivasvata</a> <a href="/d/manu" class="d">Manu</a>, being desirous of sons, worshiped the Supreme Personality of Godhead and consequently begot ten sons like <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/iksvaku" class="d">Ik&#7779;v&#257;ku</a>, all of whom were like their father. One of these sons, P&#7771;&#7779;adhra, was engaged in the duty of protecting cows at night with a sword in his hand. Following the order of his spiritual master, he would stand in this way for the entire night. Once, in the darkness of night, a tiger seized a cow from the cowshed, and when P&#7771;&#7779;adhra came to know this, he took a sword in his hand and followed the tiger. Unfortunately, when he finally approached the tiger, he could not distinguish between the cow and the tiger in the dark, and thus he killed the cow. Because of this, his spiritual master cursed him to take birth in a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sudra" class="d">&#347;&#363;dra</a></span> family, but P&#7771;&#7779;adhra practiced mystic <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a>,</span> and in <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">bhakti</a>-<a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> he worshiped the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then he voluntarily entered a blazing forest fire, thus relinquishing his material body and going back home, back to Godhead.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level"><a href="/d/kavi" class="d">Kavi</a>, the youngest son of <a href="/d/manu" class="d">Manu</a>, was a great devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead from his very childhood. From Manu&rsquo;s son known as <a href="/d/karusa" class="d">Kar&#363;&#7779;a</a>, a sect of <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas</span> known as K&#257;r&#363;&#7779;as was generated. <a href="/d/manu" class="d">Manu</a> also had a son known as <a href="/d/dhrsta" class="d">Dh&#7771;&#7779;&#7789;a</a>, from whom another sect of <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas</span> was generated, but although they were born of one who had the qualities of a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/ksatriya" class="d">k&#7779;atriya</a>,</span> they became <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as.</span> From <a href="/d/nrga" class="d">N&#7771;ga</a>, another son of <a href="/d/manu" class="d">Manu</a>, came the sons and grandsons known as Sumati, Bh&#363;tajyoti and <a href="/d/vasu" class="d">Vasu</a>. From <a href="/d/vasu" class="d">Vasu</a>, in succession, came Prat&#299;ka, and from him came <a href="/d/oghavan" class="d">Oghav&#257;n</a>. Descending in order from the seminal dynasty of <a href="/d/narisyanta" class="d">Nari&#7779;yanta</a>, another son of <a href="/d/manu" class="d">Manu</a>, were <a href="/d/citrasena" class="d">Citrasena</a>, &#7770;k&#7779;a, <a href="/d/midhvan" class="d">M&#299;&#7693;hv&#257;n</a>, <a href="/d/purna" class="d">P&#363;r&#7751;a</a>, <a href="/d/indrasena" class="d">Indrasena</a>, <a href="/d/vitihotra" class="d">V&#299;tihotra</a>, Satya&#347;rav&#257;, Uru&#347;rav&#257;, Devadatta and Agnive&#347;ya. From the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/ksatriya" class="d">k&#7779;atriya</a></span> known as Agnive&#347;ya came the celebrated <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> dynasty known as &#256;gnive&#347;y&#257;yana. From the seminal dynasty of <a href="/d/dista" class="d">Di&#7779;&#7789;a</a>, another son of <a href="/d/manu" class="d">Manu</a>, came <a href="/d/nabhaga" class="d">N&#257;bh&#257;ga</a>, and from him in succession came Bhalandana, Vatsapr&#299;ti, Pr&#257;&#7745;&#347;u, Pramati, Khanitra, <a href="/d/caksusa" class="d">C&#257;k&#7779;u&#7779;a</a>, Vivi&#7745;&#347;ati, <a href="/d/rambha" class="d">Rambha</a>, Khan&#299;netra, Karandhama, <a href="/d/aviksit" class="d">Av&#299;k&#7779;it</a>, Marutta, <a href="/d/dama" class="d">Dama</a>, R&#257;jyavardhana, Sudh&#7771;ti, <a href="/d/nara" class="d">Nara</a>, <a href="/d/kevala" class="d">Kevala</a>, <a href="/d/dhundhuman" class="d">Dhundhum&#257;n</a>, <a href="/d/vegavan" class="d">Vegav&#257;n</a>, <a href="/d/budha" class="d">Budha</a> and T&#7771;&#7751;abindu. In this way, many sons and grandsons were born in this dynasty. From T&#7771;&#7751;abindu came a daughter named <a href="/d/ilavila" class="d">Ilavil&#257;</a>, from whom <a href="/d/kuvera" class="d">Kuvera</a> took birth. T&#7771;&#7751;abindu also had three sons, named <a href="/d/visala" class="d">Vi&#347;&#257;la</a>, &#346;&#363;nyabandhu and Dh&#363;mraketu. The son of <a href="/d/visala" class="d">Vi&#347;&#257;la</a> was Hemacandra, his son was <a href="/d/dhumraksa" class="d">Dh&#363;mr&#257;k&#7779;a</a>, and his son was <a href="/d/samyama" class="d">Sa&#7745;yama</a>. The sons of <a href="/d/samyama" class="d">Sa&#7745;yama</a> were Devaja and K&#7771;&#347;&#257;&#347;va. K&#7771;&#347;&#257;&#347;va&rsquo;s son, Somadatta, performed an <a href="/d/asvamedha" class="d">A&#347;vamedha</a> sacrifice, and by worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead, <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a>, he achieved the supreme perfection of going back home, back to Godhead.</div>
