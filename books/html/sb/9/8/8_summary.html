<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">In this Eighth Chapter the descendants of <a href="/d/rohita" class="d">Rohita</a> are described. In the dynasty of <a href="/d/rohita" class="d">Rohita</a> there was a king named <a href="/d/sagara" class="d">Sagara</a>, whose history is described in relation to Kapiladeva and the destruction of the sons of <a href="/d/sagara" class="d">Sagara</a>.</div>
</div><A NAME="112509"></A><div id="112509"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">The son of <a href="/d/rohita" class="d">Rohita</a> was known as <a href="/d/harita" class="d">Harita</a>, and the son of <a href="/d/harita" class="d">Harita</a> was <a href="/d/campa" class="d">Campa</a>, who constructed a township known as Camp&#257;pur&#299;. The son of <a href="/d/campa" class="d">Campa</a> was Sudeva, the son of Sudeva was <a href="/d/vijaya" class="d">Vijaya</a>, the son of <a href="/d/vijaya" class="d">Vijaya</a> was Bharuka, and the son of Bharuka was <a href="/d/vrka" class="d">V&#7771;ka</a>. B&#257;huka, the son of <a href="/d/vrka" class="d">V&#7771;ka</a>, was greatly disturbed by his enemies, and therefore he left home with his wife and went to the forest. When he died there, his wife wanted to accept the principles of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sati" class="d">sat&#299;</a>,</span> dying with her husband, but when she was about to die a sage named <a href="/d/aurva" class="d">Aurva</a> found that she was pregnant and forbade her to do so. The co-wives of this wife of B&#257;huka gave her poison with her food, but still her son was born with the poison. The son was therefore named <a href="/d/sagara" class="d">Sagara</a> (<span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sa" class="d">sa</a></span> means &ldquo;with,&rdquo; and <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/gara" class="d">gara</a></span> means &ldquo;poison&rdquo;). Following the instructions of the great sage <a href="/d/aurva" class="d">Aurva</a>, King <a href="/d/sagara" class="d">Sagara</a> reformed many clans, including the Yavanas, &#346;akas, Haihayas and Barbaras. The king did not kill them, but reformed them. Then, again following the instructions of <a href="/d/aurva" class="d">Aurva</a>, King <a href="/d/sagara" class="d">Sagara</a> performed <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/asvamedha" class="d">a&#347;vamedha</a></span> sacrifices, but the horse needed for such a sacrifice was stolen by <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a>, the King of heaven. King <a href="/d/sagara" class="d">Sagara</a> had two wives, named Sumati and Ke&#347;in&#299;. While searching for the horse, the sons of Sumati extensively dug up the surface of the earth and in this way dug a trench, which later became known as the <a href="/d/sagara" class="d">S&#257;gara</a> Ocean. In the course of this search, they came upon the great personality Kapiladeva and thought Him to have stolen the horse. With this offensive understanding, they attacked Him and were all burned to ashes. Ke&#347;in&#299;, the second wife of King <a href="/d/sagara" class="d">Sagara</a>, had a son named Asama&ntilde;jasa, whose son <a href="/d/amsuman" class="d">A&#7745;&#347;um&#257;n</a> later searched for the horse and delivered his uncles. Upon approaching Kapiladeva, <a href="/d/amsuman" class="d">A&#7745;&#347;um&#257;n</a> saw both the horse meant for sacrifice and a <a href="/d/pile" class="d">pile</a> of ashes. <a href="/d/amsuman" class="d">A&#7745;&#347;um&#257;n</a> offered prayers to Kapiladeva, who was very pleased by his prayers and who returned the horse. After getting back the horse, however, <a href="/d/amsuman" class="d">A&#7745;&#347;um&#257;n</a> still stood before Kapiladeva, and Kapiladeva could understand that <a href="/d/amsuman" class="d">A&#7745;&#347;um&#257;n</a> was praying for the deliverance of his forefathers. Thus Kapiladeva offered the instruction that they could be delivered by water from the Ganges. <a href="/d/amsuman" class="d">A&#7745;&#347;um&#257;n</a> then offered respectful obeisances to Kapiladeva, circumambulated Him, and left that place with the horse for sacrifice. When King <a href="/d/sagara" class="d">Sagara</a> finished his <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yajna" class="d">yaj&ntilde;a</a>,</span> he handed over the kingdom to <a href="/d/amsuman" class="d">A&#7745;&#347;um&#257;n</a> and, following the advice of <a href="/d/aurva" class="d">Aurva</a>, attained salvation.</div>
