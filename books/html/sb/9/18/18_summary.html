<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">When <a href="/d/nahusa" class="d">Nahu&#7779;a</a>, who had six sons, was cursed to become a python, his eldest son, <a href="/d/yati" class="d">Yati</a>, took <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sannyasa" class="d">sanny&#257;sa</a>,</span> and therefore the next son, Yay&#257;ti, was enthroned as king. By providence, Yay&#257;ti married the daughter of &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya. &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya was a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> and Yay&#257;ti a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/ksatriya" class="d">k&#7779;atriya</a>,</span> but Yay&#257;ti married her nonetheless. &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya&rsquo;s daughter, named <a href="/d/devayani" class="d">Devay&#257;n&#299;</a>, had a girl friend named &#346;armi&#7779;&#7789;h&#257;, who was the daughter of <a href="/d/vrsaparva" class="d">V&#7771;&#7779;aparv&#257;</a>. King Yay&#257;ti married &#346;armi&#7779;&#7789;h&#257; also. The history of this marriage is as follows. Once &#346;armi&#7779;&#7789;h&#257; was sporting in the water with thousands of her girl friends, and <a href="/d/devayani" class="d">Devay&#257;n&#299;</a> was also there. When the young girls saw Lord &#346;iva, seated on his bull with <a href="/d/uma" class="d">Um&#257;</a>, they immediately dressed themselves, but &#346;armi&#7779;&#7789;h&#257; mistakenly put on Devay&#257;n&#299;&rsquo;s clothes. <a href="/d/devayani" class="d">Devay&#257;n&#299;</a>, being very angry, rebuked &#346;armi&#7779;&#7789;h&#257;, who also became very angry and responded by rebuking <a href="/d/devayani" class="d">Devay&#257;n&#299;</a> and throwing her into a well. By chance, King Yay&#257;ti came to that well to drink water, and he found <a href="/d/devayani" class="d">Devay&#257;n&#299;</a> and rescued her. Thus <a href="/d/devayani" class="d">Devay&#257;n&#299;</a> accepted <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> Yay&#257;ti as her husband. Thereafter, <a href="/d/devayani" class="d">Devay&#257;n&#299;</a>, crying loudly, told her father about &#346;armi&#7779;&#7789;h&#257;&rsquo;s behavior. Upon hearing of this incident, &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya was very angry and wanted to chastise <a href="/d/vrsaparva" class="d">V&#7771;&#7779;aparv&#257;</a>, &#346;armi&#7779;&#7789;h&#257;&rsquo;s father. <a href="/d/vrsaparva" class="d">V&#7771;&#7779;aparv&#257;</a>, however, satisfied &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya by offering &#346;armi&#7779;&#7789;h&#257; as Devay&#257;n&#299;&rsquo;s maidservant. Thus &#346;armi&#7779;&#7789;h&#257;, as the maidservant of <a href="/d/devayani" class="d">Devay&#257;n&#299;</a>, also went to the house of Devay&#257;n&#299;&rsquo;s husband. When &#346;armi&#7779;&#7789;h&#257; found her friend <a href="/d/devayani" class="d">Devay&#257;n&#299;</a> with a son she also desired to have a son. Therefore, at the proper time for conception, she also requested <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> Yay&#257;ti for sex. When &#346;armi&#7779;&#7789;h&#257; became pregnant also, <a href="/d/devayani" class="d">Devay&#257;n&#299;</a> was very envious. In great anger, she immediately left for her father&rsquo;s house and told her father everything. &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya again became angry and cursed <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> Yay&#257;ti to become old, but when Yay&#257;ti begged &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya to be merciful to him, &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya gave him the benediction that he could transfer his old age and invalidity to some young man. Yay&#257;ti exchanged his old age for the youth of his youngest son, <a href="/d/puru" class="d">P&#363;ru</a>, and thus he was able to enjoy with young girls.</div>
