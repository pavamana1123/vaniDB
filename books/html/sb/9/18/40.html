<div class="First">Renunciation of material enjoyment is the ultimate goal of human life. Therefore the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/varnasrama" class="d">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama</a></span> institution is most scientific. It aims at giving one the facility to return home, back to Godhead, which one cannot do without completely renouncing all connections with the material world. &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/caitanya" class="d">Caitanya</a> <a href="/d/mahaprabhu" class="d">Mah&#257;prabhu</a> said, <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/niskincanasya" class="d">ni&#7779;ki&ntilde;canasya</a> bhagavad-bhajanonmukhasya:</span> one who wants to go back home, back to Godhead, must be <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/niskincana" class="d">ni&#7779;ki&ntilde;cana</a>,</span> free from all affinity for material enjoyment. <span class="Italic">Brahma&#7751;y upa&#347;am&#257;&#347;rayam:</span> unless one is fully renounced, one cannot engage in devotional service or stay in <a href="/d/brahman" class="d">Brahman</a>. Devotional service is rendered on the <a href="/d/brahman" class="d">Brahman</a> platform. Therefore, unless one attains the <a href="/d/brahman" class="d">Brahman</a> platform, or spiritual platform, one cannot engage in devotional service; or, in other words, a person engaged in devotional service is already on the <a href="/d/brahman" class="d">Brahman</a> platform.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;One who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any circumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of <a href="/d/brahman" class="d">Brahman</a>.&rdquo; (Bg. <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/14/26?d=1">14.26</a>) If one attains devotional service, therefore, he is certainly liberated. Generally, unless one enjoys material happiness, one cannot attain renunciation. <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/varnasrama" class="d">Var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama</a></span> therefore gives the opportunity for gradual elevation. <a href="/d/yadu" class="d">Yadu</a>, the son of <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> Yay&#257;ti, explained that he was unable to give up his youth, for he wanted to use it to attain the renounced order in the future.</div>
<A NAME="117507"></A><div id="117507"> </div>
<div class="Purport"><a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/yadu" class="d">Yadu</a> was different from his brothers. As stated in the next verse, <span class="Italic">turvasu&#347; <a href="/d/coditah" class="d">codita&#7717;</a> <a href="/d/pitra" class="d">pitr&#257;</a> druhyu&#347; c&#257;nu&#347; <a href="/d/ca" class="d">ca</a> <a href="/d/bharata" class="d">bh&#257;rata</a>/ praty&#257;cakhyur adharmaj&ntilde;&#257;&#7717;.</span> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> Yadu&rsquo;s brothers refused to accept their father&rsquo;s proposal because they were not completely aware of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/dharma" class="d">dharma</a>.</span> To accept orders that follow religious principles, especially the orders of one&rsquo;s father, is very important. Therefore when the brothers of <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/yadu" class="d">Yadu</a> refused their father&rsquo;s order, this was certainly irreligious. <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> Yadu&rsquo;s refusal, however, was religious. As stated in the Tenth Canto, <span class="Italic">yado&#347; <a href="/d/ca" class="d">ca</a> <a href="/d/dharma" class="d">dharma</a>-<a href="/d/silaya" class="d">&#347;&#299;l&#257;ya</a>:</span> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/yadu" class="d">Yadu</a> was completely aware of the principles of religion. The ultimate principle of religion is to engage oneself in devotional service to the Lord. <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/yadu" class="d">Yadu</a> was very eager to engage himself in the Lord&rsquo;s service, but there was an impediment: during youth the material desire to enjoy the material senses is certainly present, and unless one fully satisfies these lusty desires in youth, there is a chance of one&rsquo;s being disturbed in rendering service to the Lord. We have actually seen that many <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;s</span> who accept <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sannyasa" class="d">sanny&#257;sa</a></span> prematurely, not having satisfied their material desires, fall down because they are disturbed. Therefore the general process is to go through <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/grhastha" class="d">g&#7771;hastha</a></span> life and <span class="Italic">v&#257;naprastha</span> life and finally come to <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sannyasa" class="d">sanny&#257;sa</a></span> and devote oneself completely to the service of the Lord. <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/yadu" class="d">Yadu</a> was ready to accept his father&rsquo;s order and exchange youth for old age because he was confident that the youth taken by his father would be returned. But because this exchange would delay his complete engagement in devotional service, he did not want to accept his father&rsquo;s old age, for he was eager to achieve freedom from disturbances. Moreover, among the descendants of <a href="/d/yadu" class="d">Yadu</a> would be Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. Therefore, because <a href="/d/yadu" class="d">Yadu</a> was eager to see the Lord&rsquo;s appearance in his dynasty as soon as possible, <a href="/d/yadu" class="d">Yadu</a> refused to accept his father&rsquo;s proposal. This was not irreligious, however, because Yadu&rsquo;s purpose was to serve the Lord. Because <a href="/d/yadu" class="d">Yadu</a> was a faithful servant of the Lord, Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> appeared in his dynasty. As confirmed in the prayers of <a href="/d/kunti" class="d">Kunt&#299;</a>, <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yadoh" class="d">yado&#7717;</a> priyasy&#257;nvav&#257;ye.</span> <a href="/d/yadu" class="d">Yadu</a> was very dear to <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, who was therefore eager to descend in Yadu&rsquo;s dynasty. In conclusion, <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/yadu" class="d">Yadu</a> should not be considered <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/adharma" class="d">adharma</a> <a href="/d/jna" class="d">j&ntilde;a</a>,</span> ignorant of religious principles, as the next verse designates his brothers. He was like the four Sanakas (<span class="Italic"><a href="/d/catuh" class="d">catu&#7717;</a>-<a href="/d/sana" class="d">sana</a></span>), who refused the order of their father, <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a>, for the sake of a better cause. Because the four Kum&#257;ras wanted to engage themselves completely in the service of the Lord as <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;s,</span> their refusal to obey their father&rsquo;s order was not irreligious.</div>
