<div class="First">The &#346;uka mentioned here is different from the &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; who spoke <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a>.</span> &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, the son of Vy&#257;sadeva, is described in great detail in the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahma</a>-vaivarta <a href="/d/purana" class="d">Pur&#257;&#7751;a</a>.</span> There it is said that Vy&#257;sadeva maintained the daughter of J&#257;b&#257;li as his wife and that after they performed penances together for many years, he placed his seed in her womb. The child remained in the womb of his mother for twelve years, and when the father asked the son to come out, the son replied that he would not come out unless he were completely liberated from the influence of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/maya" class="d">m&#257;y&#257;</a>.</span> Vy&#257;sadeva then assured the child that he would not be influenced by <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/maya" class="d">m&#257;y&#257;</a>,</span> but the child did not believe his father, for the father was still attached to his wife and children. Vy&#257;sadeva then went to <a href="/d/dvaraka" class="d">Dv&#257;rak&#257;</a> and informed the Personality of Godhead about his problem, and the Personality of Godhead, at Vy&#257;sadeva&rsquo;s request, went to Vy&#257;sadeva&rsquo;s cottage, where He assured the child in the womb that he would not be influenced by <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/maya" class="d">m&#257;y&#257;</a>.</span> Thus assured, the child came out, but he immediately went away as a <span class="Italic">parivr&#257;jak&#257;c&#257;rya.</span> When the father, very much aggrieved, began to follow his saintly boy, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, the boy created a duplicate &#346;ukadeva, who later entered family life. Therefore, the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/suka" class="d">&#347;uka</a>-<a href="/d/kanya" class="d">kany&#257;</a>,</span> or daughter of &#346;ukadeva, mentioned in this verse is the daughter of the duplicate or imitation &#346;ukadeva. The original &#346;ukadeva was a lifelong <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmacari" class="d">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</a>.</span></div>
