<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">This Twenty-first Chapter describes the dynasty born from <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/bharata" class="d">Bharata</a>, the son of <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/dusmanta" class="d">Du&#7779;manta</a>, and it also describes the glories of <a href="/d/rantideva" class="d">Rantideva</a>, <a href="/d/ajamidha" class="d">Ajam&#299;&#7693;ha</a> and others.</div>
</div><A NAME="118549"></A><div id="118549"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">The son of Bharadv&#257;ja was <a href="/d/manyu" class="d">Manyu</a>, and Manyu&rsquo;s sons were B&#7771;hatk&#7779;atra, <a href="/d/jaya" class="d">Jaya</a>, Mah&#257;v&#299;rya, <a href="/d/nara" class="d">Nara</a> and <a href="/d/garga" class="d">Garga</a>. Of these five, <a href="/d/nara" class="d">Nara</a> had a son named Sa&#7749;k&#7771;ti, who had two sons, named <a href="/d/guru" class="d">Guru</a> and <a href="/d/rantideva" class="d">Rantideva</a>. As an exalted devotee, <a href="/d/rantideva" class="d">Rantideva</a> saw every living entity in relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore he completely engaged his mind, his words and his very self in the service of the Supreme Lord and His devotees. <a href="/d/rantideva" class="d">Rantideva</a> was so exalted that he would sometimes give away his own food in charity, and he and his family would fast. Once, after <a href="/d/rantideva" class="d">Rantideva</a> spent forty-eight days fasting, not even drinking water, excellent food made with ghee was brought to him, but when he was about to eat it a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> guest appeared. <a href="/d/rantideva" class="d">Rantideva</a>, therefore, did not eat the food, but instead immediately offered a portion of it to the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a>.</span> When the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> left and <a href="/d/rantideva" class="d">Rantideva</a> was just about to eat the remnants of the food, a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sudra" class="d">&#347;&#363;dra</a></span> appeared. <a href="/d/rantideva" class="d">Rantideva</a> therefore divided the remnants between the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sudra" class="d">&#347;&#363;dra</a></span> and himself. Again, when he was just about to eat the remnants of the food, another guest appeared. <a href="/d/rantideva" class="d">Rantideva</a> therefore gave the rest of the food to the new guest and was about to content himself with drinking the water to quench his thirst, but this also was precluded, for a thirsty guest came and <a href="/d/rantideva" class="d">Rantideva</a> gave him the water. This was all ordained by the Supreme Personality of Godhead just to glorify His devotee and show how tolerant a devotee is in rendering service to the Lord. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, being extremely pleased with <a href="/d/rantideva" class="d">Rantideva</a>, entrusted him with very confidential service. The special power to render the most confidential service is entrusted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to a pure devotee, not to ordinary devotees.</div>
