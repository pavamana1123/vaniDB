<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Yuvan&#257;&#347;va married one hundred wives, but he had no sons, and therefore he entered the forest. In the forest, the sages performed a sacrifice known as <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a>-<a href="/d/yajna" class="d">yaj&ntilde;a</a> on his behalf. Once, however, the King became so thirsty in the forest that he drank the water kept for performing <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yajna" class="d">yaj&ntilde;a</a>.</span> Consequently, after some time, a son came forth from the right side of his abdomen. The son, who was very beautiful, was crying to drink breast milk, and <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a> gave the child his index finger to suck. Thus the son became known as <a href="/d/mandhata" class="d">M&#257;ndh&#257;t&#257;</a>. In due course of time, Yuvan&#257;&#347;va achieved perfection by performing austerities.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Thereafter, <a href="/d/mandhata" class="d">M&#257;ndh&#257;t&#257;</a> became the emperor and ruled the earth, which consists of seven islands. Thieves and rogues were very much afraid of this powerful king, and therefore the king was known as Trasaddasyu, meaning &ldquo;one who is very fearful to rogues and thieves.&rdquo; <a href="/d/mandhata" class="d">M&#257;ndh&#257;t&#257;</a> begot sons in the womb of his wife, Bindumat&#299;. These sons were Purukutsa, <a href="/d/ambarisa" class="d">Ambar&#299;&#7779;a</a> and <a href="/d/mucukunda" class="d">Mucukunda</a>. These three sons had fifty sisters, all of whom became wives of the great sage known as <a href="/d/saubhari" class="d">Saubhari</a>.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">In this connection, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; described the history of <a href="/d/saubhari" class="d">Saubhari</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a>, who, because of sensual agitation caused by fish, fell from his <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> and wanted to marry all the daughters of <a href="/d/mandhata" class="d">M&#257;ndh&#257;t&#257;</a> for sexual pleasure. Later, <a href="/d/saubhari" class="d">Saubhari</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> became very regretful. Thus he accepted the order of <span class="Italic">v&#257;naprastha,</span> performed very severe austerities, and thus attained perfection. In this regard, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; described how <a href="/d/saubhari" class="d">Saubhari</a> Muni&rsquo;s wives also became perfect.</div>
