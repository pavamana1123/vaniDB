<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">This Nineteenth Chapter describes how <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> Yay&#257;ti achieved liberation after he recounted the figurative story of the he-goat and she-goat.</div>
</div><A NAME="117661"></A><div id="117661"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">After many, many years of sexual relationships and enjoyment in the material world, King Yay&#257;ti finally became disgusted with such materialistic happiness. When satiated with material enjoyment, he devised a story of a he-goat and she-goat, corresponding to his own life, and narrated the story before his beloved <a href="/d/devayani" class="d">Devay&#257;n&#299;</a>. The story is as follows. Once upon a time, while a goat was searching in a forest for different types of vegetables to eat, by chance he came to a well, in which he saw a she-goat. He became attracted to this she-goat and somehow or other delivered her from the well, and thus they were united. One day thereafter, when the she-goat saw the he-goat enjoying sex with another she-goat, she became angry, abandoned the he-goat, and returned to her <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> owner, to whom she described her husband&rsquo;s behavior. The <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> became very angry and cursed the he-goat to lose his sexual power. Thereupon, the he-goat begged the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a&rsquo;s</span> pardon and was given back the power for sex. Then the he-goat enjoyed sex with the she-goat for many years, but still he was not satisfied. If one is lusty and greedy, even the total stock of gold in this world cannot satisfy one&rsquo;s lusty desires. These desires are like a fire. One may pour clarified butter on a blazing fire, but one cannot expect the fire to be extinguished. To extinguish such a fire, one must adopt a different process. The <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sastra" class="d">&#347;&#257;stra</a></span> therefore advises that by intelligence one renounce the life of enjoyment. Without great endeavor, those with a poor fund of knowledge cannot give up sense enjoyment, especially in relation to sex, because a beautiful woman bewilders even the most learned man. King Yay&#257;ti, however, renounced worldly life and divided his property among his sons. He personally adopted the life of a mendicant, or <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sannyasi" class="d">sanny&#257;s&#299;</a>,</span> giving up all attraction to material enjoyment, and engaged himself fully in devotional service to the Lord. Thus he attained perfection. Later, when his beloved wife, <a href="/d/devayani" class="d">Devay&#257;n&#299;</a>, was freed from her mistaken way of life, she also engaged herself in the devotional service of the Lord.</div>
