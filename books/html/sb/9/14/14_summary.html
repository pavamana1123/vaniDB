<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">The summary of this Fourteenth Chapter is given as follows. This chapter describes <a href="/d/soma" class="d">Soma</a> and how he kidnapped the wife of <a href="/d/brhaspati" class="d">B&#7771;haspati</a> and begot in her womb a son named <a href="/d/budha" class="d">Budha</a>. <a href="/d/budha" class="d">Budha</a> begot Pur&#363;rav&#257;, who begot six sons, headed by &#256;yu, in the womb of <a href="/d/urvasi" class="d">Urva&#347;&#299;</a>.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Lord <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> was born from the lotus that sprouted from the navel of Garbhodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a>. <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> had a son named <a href="/d/atri" class="d">Atri</a>, and Atri&rsquo;s son was <a href="/d/soma" class="d">Soma</a>, the king of all drugs and stars. <a href="/d/soma" class="d">Soma</a> became the conqueror of the entire universe, and, being inflated with pride, he kidnapped <a href="/d/tara" class="d">T&#257;r&#257;</a>, who was the wife of <a href="/d/brhaspati" class="d">B&#7771;haspati</a>, the spiritual master of the demigods. A great fight ensued between the demigods and the <span class="Italic">asuras,</span> but <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> rescued B&#7771;haspati&rsquo;s wife from the clutches of <a href="/d/soma" class="d">Soma</a> and returned her to her husband, thus stopping the fighting. In the womb of <a href="/d/tara" class="d">T&#257;r&#257;</a>, <a href="/d/soma" class="d">Soma</a> begot a son named <a href="/d/budha" class="d">Budha</a>, who later begot in the womb of <a href="/d/ila" class="d">Il&#257;</a> a son named <a href="/d/aila" class="d">Aila</a>, or Pur&#363;rav&#257;. <a href="/d/urvasi" class="d">Urva&#347;&#299;</a> was captivated by Pur&#363;rav&#257;&rsquo;s beauty, and therefore she lived with him for some time, but when she left his company he became almost like a madman. While traveling all over the world, he met <a href="/d/urvasi" class="d">Urva&#347;&#299;</a> again at <a href="/d/kuruksetra" class="d">Kuruk&#7779;etra</a>, but she agreed to join with him for only one night in a year.</div>
</div><A NAME="115224"></A><div id="115224"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">One year later, Pur&#363;rav&#257; saw <a href="/d/urvasi" class="d">Urva&#347;&#299;</a> at <a href="/d/kuruksetra" class="d">Kuruk&#7779;etra</a> and was glad to be with her for one night, but when he thought of her leaving him again, he was overwhelmed by grief. <a href="/d/urvasi" class="d">Urva&#347;&#299;</a> then advised Pur&#363;rav&#257; to worship the Gandharvas. Being satisfied with Pur&#363;rav&#257;, the Gandharvas gave him a woman known as Agnisth&#257;l&#299;. Pur&#363;rav&#257; mistook Agnisth&#257;l&#299; for <a href="/d/urvasi" class="d">Urva&#347;&#299;</a>, but while he was wandering in the forest his misunderstanding was cleared, and he immediately gave up her company. After returning home and meditating upon <a href="/d/urvasi" class="d">Urva&#347;&#299;</a> all night, he wanted to perform a Vedic ritualistic ceremony to satisfy his desire. Thereafter he went to the same place where he had left Agnisth&#257;l&#299;, and there he saw that from the womb of a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sami" class="d">&#347;am&#299;</a></span> tree had come an <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/asvattha" class="d">a&#347;vattha</a></span> tree. Pur&#363;rav&#257; made two sticks from this tree and thus produced a fire. By such a fire one can satisfy all lusty desires. The fire was considered the son of Pur&#363;rav&#257;. In <a href="/d/satya" class="d">Satya</a>-<a href="/d/yuga" class="d">yuga</a> there was only one social division, called <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/hamsa" class="d">ha&#7745;sa</a>;</span> there were no divisions of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/varna" class="d">var&#7751;a</a></span> like <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a>, <a href="/d/ksatriya" class="d">k&#7779;atriya</a>, <a href="/d/vaisya" class="d">vai&#347;ya</a></span> and <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sudra" class="d">&#347;&#363;dra</a>.</span> The <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/veda" class="d">Veda</a></span> was the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/omkara" class="d">o&#7745;k&#257;ra</a>.</span> The various demigods were not worshiped, for only the Supreme Personality of Godhead was the worshipable Deity.</div>
