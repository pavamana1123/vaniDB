From that pot, <a href="/d/agastya" class="d">Agastya</a> and <a href="/d/vasistha" class="d">Vasi&#7779;&#7789;ha</a> appeared. <a href="/d/mitra" class="d">Mitra</a> had a wife named <a href="/d/revati" class="d">Revat&#299;</a>, who gave birth to three sons&mdash;Utsarga, <a href="/d/arista" class="d">Ari&#7779;&#7789;a</a> and <a href="/d/pippala" class="d">Pippala</a>.

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">The demons born of <a href="/d/diti" class="d">Diti</a> are also described in this chapter. In the dynasty of <a href="/d/diti" class="d">Diti</a> appeared the great saintly devotee <a href="/d/prahlada" class="d">Prahl&#257;da</a> and also <a href="/d/bali" class="d">Bali</a>, Prahl&#257;da&rsquo;s grandson. Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu and <a href="/d/hiranyaksa" class="d">Hira&#7751;y&#257;k&#7779;a</a> were the first sons of <a href="/d/diti" class="d">Diti</a>.

They also had one daughter, whose name was <a href="/d/simhika" class="d">Si&#7745;hik&#257;</a>. In association with the demon Vipracit, <a href="/d/simhika" class="d">Si&#7745;hik&#257;</a> bore a son named <a href="/d/rahu" class="d">R&#257;hu</a>, whose head was severed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. <a href="/d/krti" class="d">K&#7771;ti</a>, the wife of Sa&#7745;hl&#257;da, bore a son named Pa&ntilde;cajana.

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">After describing the dynasty of the &#256;dityas and the other demigods, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; describes Diti&rsquo;s sons known as the Maruts and how they were elevated to the position of demigods. Just to help <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a>, Lord <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a> had killed <a href="/d/hiranyaksa" class="d">Hira&#7751;y&#257;k&#7779;a</a> and Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu. Because of this, <a href="/d/diti" class="d">Diti</a> was very envious, and she was eager to have a son who could kill <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a>. By her service, she enchanted <a href="/d/kasyapa" class="d">Ka&#347;yapa</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> in order to beg from him a greater son to do this. In corroboration of the Vedic injunction <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/vidvamsam" class="d">vidv&#257;&#7745;sam</a> <a href="/d/api" class="d">api</a> <a href="/d/karsati" class="d">kar&#7779;ati</a>,</span> <a href="/d/kasyapa" class="d">Ka&#347;yapa</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> was attracted to his beautiful wife and promised to grant her any request. When, however, she requested a son who would kill <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a>, he condemned himself, and he advised his wife <a href="/d/diti" class="d">Diti</a> to follow the <a href="/d/vaisnava" class="d">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava</a> ritualistic ceremonies to purify herself. When <a href="/d/diti" class="d">Diti</a>, following the instructions of <a href="/d/kasyapa" class="d">Ka&#347;yapa</a>, engaged in devotional service, <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a> could understand her purpose, and he began observing all her activities. One day, <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a> had the opportunity to see her deviating from devotional service. Thus he entered her womb and cut her son into forty-nine parts. In this way the forty-nine kinds of air known as the Maruts appeared, but because <a href="/d/diti" class="d">Diti</a> had performed the <a href="/d/vaisnava" class="d">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava</a> ritualistic ceremonies, all the sons became Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas.</div>
