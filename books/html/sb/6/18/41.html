<div class="Translation">A woman&rsquo;s face is as attractive and beautiful as a blossoming lotus flower during autumn. Her words are very sweet, and they give pleasure to the ear, but if we study a woman&rsquo;s heart, we can understand it to be extremely sharp, like the blade of a razor. In these circumstances, who could understand the dealings of a woman?</div>

<div class="First">Woman is now depicted very well from the materialistic point of view by <a href="/d/kasyapa" class="d">Ka&#347;yapa</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a>. Women are generally known as the fair sex, and especially in youth, at the age of sixteen or seventeen, women are very attractive to men. Therefore a woman&rsquo;s face is compared to a blooming lotus flower in autumn. Just as a lotus is extremely beautiful in autumn, a woman at the threshold of youthful beauty is extremely attractive. In Sanskrit a woman&rsquo;s voice is called <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/nari" class="d">n&#257;r&#299;</a>-<a href="/d/svara" class="d">svara</a></span> because women generally sing and their singing is very attractive. At the present moment, cinema artists, especially female singers, are especially welcome. Some of them earn fabulous amounts of money simply by singing. Therefore, as taught by &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/caitanya" class="d">Caitanya</a> <a href="/d/mahaprabhu" class="d">Mah&#257;prabhu</a>, a woman&rsquo;s singing is dangerous because it can make a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sannyasi" class="d">sanny&#257;s&#299;</a></span> fall a victim to the woman. <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sannyasa" class="d">Sanny&#257;sa</a></span> means giving up the company of women, but if a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sannyasi" class="d">sanny&#257;s&#299;</a></span> hears the voice of a woman and sees her beautiful face, he certainly becomes attracted and is sure to fall down. There have been many examples. Even the great sage <a href="/d/visvamitra" class="d">Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra</a> fell a victim to Menak&#257;. Therefore a person desiring to advance in spiritual consciousness must be especially careful not to see a woman&rsquo;s face or hear a woman&rsquo;s voice. To see a woman&rsquo;s face and appreciate its beauty or to hear a woman&rsquo;s voice and appreciate her singing as very nice is a subtle falldown for a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmacari" class="d">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</a></span> or <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sannyasi" class="d">sanny&#257;s&#299;</a>.</span> Thus the description of a woman&rsquo;s features by <a href="/d/kasyapa" class="d">Ka&#347;yapa</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> is very instructive.</div>
<A NAME="85531"></A><div id="85531"> </div>
<div class="Purport">When a woman&rsquo;s bodily features are attractive, when her face is beautiful and when her voice is sweet, she is naturally a trap for a man. The <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> advise that when such a woman comes to serve a man, she should be considered to be like a dark well covered by grass. In the fields there are many such wells, and a man who does not know about them drops through the grass and falls down. Thus there are many such instructions. Since the attraction of the material world is based on attraction for women, <a href="/d/kasyapa" class="d">Ka&#347;yapa</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> thought, &ldquo;Under the circumstances, who can understand the heart of a woman?&rdquo; C&#257;&#7751;akya <a href="/d/pandita" class="d">Pa&#7751;&#7693;ita</a> has also advised, <span class="Italic">vi&#347;v&#257;so naiva <a href="/d/kartavyah" class="d">kartavya&#7717;</a> <a href="/d/strisu" class="d">str&#299;&#7779;u</a> <a href="/d/raja" class="d">r&#257;ja</a>-kule&#7779;u <a href="/d/ca" class="d">ca</a>:</span> &ldquo;There are two persons one should not trust&mdash;a politician and a woman.&rdquo; These, of course, are authoritative &#347;&#257;stric injunctions, and we should therefore be very careful in our dealings with women.</div>
<A NAME="85532"></A><div id="85532"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Sometimes our <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness movement is criticized for mingling men and women, but <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness is meant for anyone. Whether one is a man or woman does not matter. Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> personally says, <span class="Italic">striyo vai&#347;y&#257;s <a href="/d/tatha" class="d">tath&#257;</a> &#347;&#363;dr&#257;s <a href="/d/te" class="d">te</a> &rsquo;pi <a href="/d/yanti" class="d">y&#257;nti</a> <a href="/d/param" class="d">par&#257;&#7745;</a> <a href="/d/gatim" class="d">gatim</a>:</span> whether one is a woman, <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sudra" class="d">&#347;&#363;dra</a></span> or <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/vaisya" class="d">vai&#347;ya</a>,</span> not to speak of being a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> or <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/ksatriya" class="d">k&#7779;atriya</a>,</span> everyone is fit to return home, back to Godhead, if he strictly follows the instructions of the spiritual master and <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sastra" class="d">&#347;&#257;stra</a>.</span> We therefore request all the members of the <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness movement&mdash;both men and women&mdash;not to be attracted by bodily features but only to be attracted by <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. Then everything will be all right. Otherwise there will be danger.</div>
