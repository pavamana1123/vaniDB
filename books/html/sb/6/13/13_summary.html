<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">This chapter describes Indra&rsquo;s fear at having killed a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> (V&#7771;tr&#257;sura), and it also describes how he fled and was saved by the grace of Lord <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a>.</div>
</div><A NAME="82051"></A><div id="82051"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">When all the demigods requested <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a> to kill V&#7771;tr&#257;sura, he refused because V&#7771;tr&#257;sura was a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a>.</span> The demigods, however, encouraged <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a> not to fear killing him because <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a> was protected by the <a href="/d/narayana" class="d">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</a>-kavaca, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, Lord <a href="/d/narayana" class="d">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</a>. Even by a glimpse of the chanting of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a&rsquo;s name, one becomes free from all the sinful reactions of killing a woman, a cow or a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a>.</span> The demigods advised <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a> to perform an <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/asvamedha" class="d">a&#347;vamedha</a></span> sacrifice, by which <a href="/d/narayana" class="d">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</a> would be pleased, for the performer of such a sacrifice is not implicated in sinful reactions even if he kills the entire universe.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Following this instruction from the demigods, King <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a> fought V&#7771;tr&#257;sura, but when V&#7771;tr&#257;sura was killed, everyone was satisfied but King <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a>, who knew V&#7771;tr&#257;sura&rsquo;s position. This is the nature of a great personality. Even if a great personality acquires some opulence, he is always ashamed and regretful if he acquires it illegally. <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a> could understand that he was certainly entangled by sinful reactions for killing a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a>.</span> Indeed, he could see sinful reaction personified following him, and thus he fled here and there in fear, thinking of how to rid himself of his sins. He went to <a href="/d/manasa" class="d">M&#257;nasa</a>-<a href="/d/sarovara" class="d">sarovara</a>, and there, under the protection of the goddess of fortune, he meditated for one thousand years. During this time, <a href="/d/nahusa" class="d">Nahu&#7779;a</a> reigned over the heavenly planets as the representative of <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a>. Unfortunately, however, he was attracted by the beauty of Indra&rsquo;s wife, &#346;ac&#299;dev&#299;, and because of his sinful desire he had to accept the body of a serpent in his next life. <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a> later performed a great sacrifice with the help of exalted <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and saints. In this way he was released from the reactions of his sinful killing of a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a>.</span></div>
