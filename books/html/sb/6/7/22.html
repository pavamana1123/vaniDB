<div class="Translation">Because of your misbehavior toward <a href="/d/brhaspati" class="d">B&#7771;haspati</a>, you have been defeated by the demons. My dear demigods, since the demons were weak, having been defeated by you several times, how else could you, who were so advanced in opulence, be defeated by them?</div>

<div class="First">The <span class="Italic">devas</span> are celebrated for fighting with the <span class="Italic">asuras</span> perpetually. In such fights the <span class="Italic">asuras</span> were always defeated, but this time the demigods were defeated. Why? The reason, as stated here, was that they had offended their spiritual master. Their impudent disrespect of their spiritual master was the cause of their defeat by the demons. As stated in the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras,</span> when one disrespects a respectable superior, one loses his longevity and the results of his pious activities, and in this way one is degraded.</div>
