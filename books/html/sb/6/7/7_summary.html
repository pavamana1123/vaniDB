<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">As related in this chapter, <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a>, the King of heaven, committed an offense at the feet of his spiritual master, <a href="/d/brhaspati" class="d">B&#7771;haspati</a>. <a href="/d/brhaspati" class="d">B&#7771;haspati</a> therefore left the demigods, who then had no priest. However, at the request of the demigods, <a href="/d/visvarupa" class="d">Vi&#347;var&#363;pa</a>, the son of the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> <a href="/d/tvasta" class="d">Tva&#7779;&#7789;&#257;</a>, became their priest.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Once upon a time, <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a>, the King of the demigods, was sitting with his wife &#346;ac&#299;dev&#299; and being praised by various demigods like the Siddhas, C&#257;ra&#7751;as and Gandharvas when <a href="/d/brhaspati" class="d">B&#7771;haspati</a>, the spiritual master of the demigods, entered the assembly. <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a>, being too absorbed in material opulence, forgot himself and did not respect <a href="/d/brhaspati" class="d">B&#7771;haspati</a>, who thus became aware of Indra&rsquo;s pride in his material opulence and immediately disappeared from the assembly to teach him a lesson. <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a> became most repentant, understanding that because of his opulence he had forgotten to respect his spiritual master. He left the palace to beg pardon from his spiritual master, but could not find <a href="/d/brhaspati" class="d">B&#7771;haspati</a> anywhere.</div>
</div><A NAME="79121"></A><div id="79121"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Because of his disrespectful behavior toward his spiritual master. <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a> lost all his opulence and was conquered by the demons, who defeated the demigods in a great fight and occupied Indra&rsquo;s throne. King <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a>, along with the other demigods, later took shelter of Lord <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a>. Understanding the situation, Lord <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> chastised the demigods for their offense to their spiritual master. Following Lord Brahm&#257;&rsquo;s orders, the demigods accepted <a href="/d/visvarupa" class="d">Vi&#347;var&#363;pa</a>, who was a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> and the son of <a href="/d/tvasta" class="d">Tva&#7779;&#7789;&#257;</a>, as their priest. Then they performed <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;as</span> under the priesthood of <a href="/d/visvarupa" class="d">Vi&#347;var&#363;pa</a> and were able to conquer the demons.</div>
