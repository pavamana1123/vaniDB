<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">As described in this chapter, after <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a> obtained the body of Dadh&#299;ci, a thunderbolt was prepared from Dadh&#299;ci&rsquo;s bones, and a fight took place between V&#7771;tr&#257;sura and the demigods.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Following the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the demigods approached Dadh&#299;ci <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> and begged for his body. Dadh&#299;ci <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a>, just to hear from the demigods about the principles of religion, jokingly refused to relinquish his body, but for higher purposes he thereafter agreed to give it up, for after death the body is usually eaten by low animals like dogs and jackals. Dadh&#299;ci <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> first merged his gross body made of five elements into the original stock of five elements and then engaged his soul at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus he gave up his gross body. With the help of <a href="/d/visvakarma" class="d">Vi&#347;vakarm&#257;</a>, the demigods then prepared a thunderbolt from Dadh&#299;ci&rsquo;s bones. Armed with the thunderbolt weapon, they prepared themselves to fight and got up on the backs of elephants.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">At the end of <a href="/d/satya" class="d">Satya</a>-<a href="/d/yuga" class="d">yuga</a> and the beginning of <a href="/d/treta" class="d">Tret&#257;</a>-<a href="/d/yuga" class="d">yuga</a>. a great fight took place between the demigods and the <span class="Italic">asuras.</span> Unable to tolerate the effulgence of the demigods, the <span class="Italic">asuras</span> fled the battle. leaving V&#7771;tr&#257;sura, their commander in chief, to fight for himself. V&#7771;tr&#257;sura, however, seeing the demons fleeing, instructed them in the importance of fighting and dying in the battlefield. One who is victorious in battle gains material possessions, and one who dies in the battlefield attains a residence at once in the celestial heavens. In either way, the fighter benefits.</div>
