<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">As described in this chapter, <a href="/d/prajapati" class="d">Praj&#257;pati</a> <a href="/d/daksa" class="d">Dak&#7779;a</a> begot sixty daughters in the womb of his wife <a href="/d/asikni" class="d">Asikn&#299;</a>. These daughters were given in charity to various persons to increase the population. Since these offspring of <a href="/d/daksa" class="d">Dak&#7779;a</a> were women, <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> did not try to lead them toward the renounced order of life. Thus the daughters were saved from <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a>. Ten of the daughters were given in marriage to <a href="/d/dharmaraja" class="d">Dharmar&#257;ja</a>, thirteen to <a href="/d/kasyapa" class="d">Ka&#347;yapa</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a>, and twenty-seven to the moon-god, <a href="/d/candra" class="d">Candra</a>. In this way fifty daughters were distributed, and of the other ten daughters, four were given to <a href="/d/kasyapa" class="d">Ka&#347;yapa</a> and two each to <a href="/d/bhuta" class="d">Bh&#363;ta</a>, A&#7749;gir&#257; and K&#7771;&#347;&#257;&#347;va. One should know that it is because of the union of these sixty daughters with various exalted personalities that the entire universe was filled with various kinds of living entities, such as human beings, demigods, demons, beasts, birds and serpents.</div>
