<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">This chapter describes how <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a>, the King of heaven, killed V&#7771;tr&#257;sura despite great reluctance.</div>
</div><A NAME="81582"></A><div id="81582"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">After V&#7771;tr&#257;sura finished speaking, he released his trident against King <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a> with great anger, but <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a>, using his thunderbolt, which was many times more powerful than the trident, broke the trident to pieces and cut off one of V&#7771;tr&#257;sura&rsquo;s arms. Nevertheless, V&#7771;tr&#257;sura used his remaining arm to <a href="/d/strike" class="d">strike</a> <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a> with an iron mace, making the thunderbolt fall from Indra&rsquo;s hand. <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a>, being very ashamed of this, did not pick up the thunderbolt from the ground, but V&#7771;tr&#257;sura encouraged King <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a> to pick it up and fight. V&#7771;tr&#257;sura then spoke to King <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a> as follows, instructing him very well.</div>
</div><A NAME="81583"></A><div id="81583"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">&ldquo;The Supreme Personality of Godhead,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is the cause of victory and defeat. Not knowing that the Supreme Lord is the cause of all causes, fools and rascals try to take credit for victory or defeat themselves, but everything is actually under the control of the Lord. No one but Him has any independence. The <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/purusa" class="d">puru&#7779;a</a></span> (the enjoyer) and <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/prakrti" class="d">prak&#7771;ti</a></span> (the enjoyed) are under the control of the Lord, for it is by His supervision that everything works systematically. Not seeing the hand of the Supreme in every action, a fool considers himself the ruler and controller of everything. When one understands, however, that the real controller is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is freed from the relativities of the world, such as distress, happiness, fear and impurity.&rdquo; Thus <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a> and V&#7771;tr&#257;sura not only fought, but also engaged in philosophical discourses. Then they began to fight again.</div>
</div><A NAME="81584"></A><div id="81584"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">This time <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a> was more powerful, and he severed V&#7771;tr&#257;sura&rsquo;s remaining arm. V&#7771;tr&#257;sura then assumed a gigantic form and swallowed King <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a>, but <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a>, being protected by the talisman known as <a href="/d/narayana" class="d">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</a>-kavaca, was able to protect himself even within V&#7771;tr&#257;sura&rsquo;s body. Thus he emerged from V&#7771;tr&#257;sura&rsquo;s abdomen and severed the demon&rsquo;s head from his body with his powerful thunderbolt. Severing the demon&rsquo;s head took one complete year to accomplish.</div>
