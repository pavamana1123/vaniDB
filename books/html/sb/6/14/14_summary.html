<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">In this Fourteenth Chapter, <a href="/d/pariksit" class="d">Par&#299;k&#7779;it</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> asks his spiritual master, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, how such a demon as V&#7771;tr&#257;sura could become an exalted devotee. In this connection the previous life of V&#7771;tr&#257;sura is discussed. This involves the story of <a href="/d/citraketu" class="d">Citraketu</a> and how he was victimized by lamentation because of the death of his son.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Among many millions of living entities, the number of human beings is extremely small, and among human beings who are actually religious, only some are eager to be liberated from material existence. Among many thousands of people who desire relief from material existence, one is freed from the association of unwanted persons or is relieved of material contamination. And among many millions of such liberated persons, one may become a devotee of Lord <a href="/d/narayana" class="d">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</a>. Therefore such devotees are extremely rare. Since <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">bhakti</a>,</span> devotional service, is not ordinary, <a href="/d/pariksit" class="d">Par&#299;k&#7779;it</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> was astonished that an <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/asura" class="d">asura</a></span> could rise to the exalted position of a devotee. Being doubtful, <a href="/d/pariksit" class="d">Par&#299;k&#7779;it</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> inquired from &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, who then described V&#7771;tr&#257;sura with reference to his previous birth as <a href="/d/citraketu" class="d">Citraketu</a>, the King of &#346;&#363;rasena.</div>
</div><A NAME="82337"></A><div id="82337"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level"><a href="/d/citraketu" class="d">Citraketu</a>, who had no sons, got an opportunity to meet the great sage A&#7749;gir&#257;. When A&#7749;gir&#257; inquired from the King about his welfare, the King expressed his moroseness, and therefore by the grace of the great sage, the King&rsquo;s first wife, K&#7771;tadyuti, gave birth to a son, who was the cause of both happiness and lamentation. Upon the birth of this son, the King and all the residents of the palace were very happy. The co-wives of K&#7771;tadyuti, however, were envious, and later they administered poison to the child. <a href="/d/citraketu" class="d">Citraketu</a> was overwhelmed by shock at his son&rsquo;s death. Then <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> and A&#7749;gir&#257; went to see him.</div>
