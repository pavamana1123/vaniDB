<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">As described in this chapter, <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a>, the King of heaven, killed <a href="/d/visvarupa" class="d">Vi&#347;var&#363;pa</a>, and therefore Vi&#347;var&#363;pa&rsquo;s father performed a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yajna" class="d">yaj&ntilde;a</a></span> to kill <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a>. When V&#7771;tr&#257;sura appeared from that <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yajna" class="d">yaj&ntilde;a</a>,</span> the demigods, in fear, sought shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and glorified Him.</div>
</div><A NAME="80113"></A><div id="80113"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Because of affection for the demons, <a href="/d/visvarupa" class="d">Vi&#347;var&#363;pa</a> secretly supplied them the remnants of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yajna" class="d">yaj&ntilde;a</a>.</span> When <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a> learned about this, he beheaded <a href="/d/visvarupa" class="d">Vi&#347;var&#363;pa</a>, but he later regretted killing <a href="/d/visvarupa" class="d">Vi&#347;var&#363;pa</a> because <a href="/d/visvarupa" class="d">Vi&#347;var&#363;pa</a> was a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a>.</span> Although competent to neutralize the sinful reactions for killing a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a>,</span> <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a> did not do so. Instead he accepted the reactions. Later, he distributed these reactions among the land, water, trees and women in general. Since the land accepted one fourth of the sinful reactions, a portion of the land turned into desert. The trees were also given one fourth of the sinful reactions, and therefore they drip sap, which is prohibited for drinking. Because women accepted one fourth of the sinful reactions, they are untouchable during their menstrual period. Since water was also infested with sinful reactions, when bubbles appear in water it cannot be used for any purpose.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">After <a href="/d/visvarupa" class="d">Vi&#347;var&#363;pa</a> was killed, his father, <a href="/d/tvasta" class="d">Tva&#7779;&#7789;&#257;</a>, performed a sacrifice to kill King <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a>. Unfortunately, if <span class="Italic">mantras</span> are chanted irregularly, they yield an opposite result. This happened when <a href="/d/tvasta" class="d">Tva&#7779;&#7789;&#257;</a> performed this <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yajna" class="d">yaj&ntilde;a</a>.</span> While performing the sacrifice to kill <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a>. <a href="/d/tvasta" class="d">Tva&#7779;&#7789;&#257;</a> chanted a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/mantra" class="d">mantra</a></span> to increase Indra&rsquo;s enemies, but because he chanted the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/mantra" class="d">mantra</a></span> wrong, the sacrifice produced an <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/asura" class="d">asura</a></span> named V&#7771;tr&#257;sura, of whom <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a> was the enemy. When V&#7771;tr&#257;sura was generated from the sacrifice, his fierce features made the whole world afraid, and his personal effulgence diminished even the power of the demigods. Finding no other means of protection, the demigods began to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the enjoyer of all the results of sacrifice, who is supreme throughout the entire universe. The demigods all worshiped Him because ultimately no one but Him can protect a living entity from fear and danger. Seeking shelter of a demigod instead of worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead is compared to trying to cross the ocean by grasping the tail of a dog. A dog can swim, but that does not mean that one can cross the ocean by grasping a dog&rsquo;s tail.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Being pleased with the demigods, the Supreme Personality of Godhead advised them to approach Dadh&#299;ci to beg him for the bones of his own body. Dadh&#299;ci would comply with the request of the demigods, and with the help of his bones V&#7771;tr&#257;sura could be killed.</div>
