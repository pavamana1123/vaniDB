<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">This chapter relates how all the sons of <a href="/d/daksa" class="d">Dak&#7779;a</a> were delivered from the clutches of the material energy by following the advice of <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a>, who was therefore cursed by <a href="/d/daksa" class="d">Dak&#7779;a</a>.</div>
</div><A NAME="78017"></A><div id="78017"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Influenced by the external energy of Lord <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a>, <a href="/d/prajapati" class="d">Praj&#257;pati</a> <a href="/d/daksa" class="d">Dak&#7779;a</a> begot ten thousand sons in the womb of his wife, P&#257;&ntilde;cajan&#299;. These sons, who were all of the same character and mentality, were known as the Harya&#347;vas. Ordered by their father to create more and more population, the Harya&#347;vas went west to the place where the River <a href="/d/sindhu" class="d">Sindhu</a> (now the Indus) meets the Arabian Sea. In those days this was the <a href="/d/site" class="d">site</a> of a holy lake named <a href="/d/narayana" class="d">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</a>-saras, where there were many saintly persons. The Harya&#347;vas began practicing austerities, penances and meditation, which are the engagements of the highly exalted renounced order of life. However, when &#346;r&#299;la <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> saw these boys engaged in such commendable austerities simply for material creation, he thought it better to release them from this tendency. <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> described to the boys their ultimate goal of life and advised them not to become ordinary <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s</span> to beget children. Thus all the sons of <a href="/d/daksa" class="d">Dak&#7779;a</a> became enlightened and left, never to return.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level"><a href="/d/prajapati" class="d">Praj&#257;pati</a> <a href="/d/daksa" class="d">Dak&#7779;a</a>, who was very <a href="/d/sad" class="d">sad</a> at the loss of his sons, begot one thousand more sons in the womb of his wife, P&#257;&ntilde;cajan&#299;, and ordered them to increase progeny. These sons, who were named the Saval&#257;&#347;vas, also engaged in worshiping Lord <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a> to beget children, but <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> convinced them to become mendicants and not beget children. Foiled twice in his attempts to increase population, <a href="/d/prajapati" class="d">Praj&#257;pati</a> <a href="/d/daksa" class="d">Dak&#7779;a</a> became most angry at <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> and cursed him, saying that in the future he would not be able to stay anywhere. Since <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a>, being fully qualified, was fixed in tolerance, he accepted Dak&#7779;a&rsquo;s curse.</div>
