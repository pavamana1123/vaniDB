<div class="Translation">Marking these and many other omens of evil times, everyone but the four sage-sons of <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a>, who were aware of the fall of <a href="/d/jaya" class="d">Jaya</a> and <a href="/d/vijaya" class="d">Vijaya</a> and of their birth as Diti&rsquo;s sons, was seized with fear. They did not know the secrets of these portents and thought that the dissolution of the universe was at hand.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<A NAME="37535"></A><div id="37535"> </div>
<div class="First">According to <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a>,</span> Seventh Chapter, the laws of nature are so stringent that it is impossible for the living entity to surpass their enforcement. It is also explained that only those who are fully surrendered to <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> in <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness can be saved. We can learn from the description of the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a></span> that it is because of the birth of two great demons that there were so many natural disturbances. It is to be indirectly understood, as previously described, that when there are constant disturbances on the earth, that is an omen that some demoniac people have been born or that the demoniac population has increased. In former days there were only two demons&mdash;those born of <a href="/d/diti" class="d">Diti</a>&mdash;yet there were so many disturbances. At the present day, especially in this age of <a href="/d/kali" class="d">Kali</a>, these disturbances are always visible, which indicates that the demoniac population has certainly increased.</div>
<A NAME="37536"></A><div id="37536"> </div>
<div class="Purport">To check the increase of demoniac population, the Vedic civilization enacted so many rules and regulations of social life, the most important of which is the <span class="Italic">garbh&#257;dh&#257;na</span> process for begetting good children. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> informed <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> that if there is unwanted population (<span class="Italic"><a href="/d/varna" class="d">var&#7751;a</a>-<a href="/d/sankara" class="d">sa&#7749;kara</a></span>), the entire world will appear to be hell. People are very anxious for peace in the world, but there are so many unwanted children born without the benefit of the <span class="Italic">garbh&#257;dh&#257;na</span> ceremony, just like the demons born from <a href="/d/diti" class="d">Diti</a>. <a href="/d/diti" class="d">Diti</a> was so lusty that she forced her husband to copulate at a time which was inauspicious, and therefore the demons were born to create disturbances. In having sex life to beget children, one should observe the process for begetting nice children; if each and every householder in every family observes the Vedic system, then there are nice children, not demons, and automatically there is peace in the world. If we do not follow regulations in life for social tranquillity, we cannot expect peace. Rather, we will have to undergo the stringent reactions of natural laws.</div>
