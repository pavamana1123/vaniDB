<div class="First">One has to execute his prescribed duties according to his social position as a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a>, <a href="/d/ksatriya" class="d">k&#7779;atriya</a>, <a href="/d/vaisya" class="d">vai&#347;ya</a></span> or <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sudra" class="d">&#347;&#363;dra</a>.</span> The prescribed duties of the four classes of men in human society are also described in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a>.</span> The activities of <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> are to control the senses and to become simple, clean, learned devotees. The <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas</span> have the spirit for ruling, they are not afraid on the battlefield, and they are charitable. The <span class="Italic">vai&#347;yas,</span> or the mercantile class of men, trade in commodities, protect cows and develop agricultural produce. The <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras,</span> or laborer class, serve the higher classes because they themselves are not very intelligent.</div>
<A NAME="44539"></A><div id="44539"> </div>
<div class="Purport">From every position, as confirmed in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a>,</span> <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sva" class="d">sva</a>-<a href="/d/karmana" class="d">karma&#7751;&#257;</a> <a href="/d/tam" class="d">tam</a> <a href="/d/abhyarcya" class="d">abhyarcya</a>:</span> one can serve the Supreme Lord by performing one&rsquo;s prescribed duty. It is not that only the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> can serve the Supreme Lord and not the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras.</span> Anyone can serve the Supreme Lord by performing his prescribed duties under the direction of a spiritual master, or representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. No one should think that his prescribed duties are inferior. A <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> can serve the Lord by using his intelligence, and the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/ksatriya" class="d">k&#7779;atriya</a></span> can serve the Supreme Lord by using his military arts, just as <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> served <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> was a warrior; he had no time to study <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/vedanta" class="d">Ved&#257;nta</a></span> or other highly intellectual books. The damsels in Vrajadh&#257;ma were girls born of the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/vaisya" class="d">vai&#347;ya</a></span> class, and they engaged in protecting cows and producing agriculture. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s foster father, <a href="/d/nanda" class="d">Nanda</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a>, and his associates were all <span class="Italic">vai&#347;yas.</span> They were not at all educated, but they could serve <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> by loving Him and by offering everything to Him. Similarly, there are many instances in which <span class="Italic">ca&#7751;&#7693;&#257;las,</span> or those lower than <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras,</span> have served <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. Also, the sage <a href="/d/vidura" class="d">Vidura</a> was considered a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sudra" class="d">&#347;&#363;dra</a></span> because his mother happened to be <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sudra" class="d">&#347;&#363;dra</a>.</span> There are no distinctions, for it is declared by the Lord in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> that anyone engaged specifically in devotional service is elevated to the transcendental position without a doubt. Everyone&rsquo;s prescribed duty is glorious if it is performed in devotional service of the Lord, without desire for profit. Such loving service must be performed without reason, without impediment, and spontaneously. <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is lovable, and one has to serve Him in whatever capacity one can. That is pure devotional service.</div>
<A NAME="44540"></A><div id="44540"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Another significant phrase in this verse is <span class="Italic">n&#257;tihi&#7745;sre&#7751;a</span> (&ldquo;with minimum violence or sacrifice of life&rdquo;). Even if a devotee has to commit violence, it should not be done beyond what is necessary. Sometimes the question is put before us: &ldquo;You ask us not to eat meat, but you are eating vegetables. Do you think that is not violence?&rdquo; The answer is that eating vegetables is violence, and vegetarians are also committing violence against other living entities because vegetables also have life. Nondevotees are killing cows, goats and so many other animals for eating purposes, and a devotee, who is vegetarian, is also killing. But here, significantly, it is stated that every living entity has to live by killing another entity; that is the law of nature. <span class="Italic">J&#299;vo <a href="/d/jivasya" class="d">j&#299;vasya</a> <a href="/d/jivanam" class="d">j&#299;vanam</a>:</span> one living entity is the life for another living entity. But for a human being, that violence should be committed only as much as necessary.</div>
<A NAME="44541"></A><div id="44541"> </div>
<div class="Purport">A human being is not to eat anything which is not offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yajna" class="d">Yaj&ntilde;a</a>-&#347;i&#7779;&#7789;&#257;&#347;ina&#7717; <a href="/d/santah" class="d">santa&#7717;</a>:</span> one becomes freed from all sinful reactions by eating foodstuffs which are offered to <a href="/d/yajna" class="d">Yaj&ntilde;a</a>, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A devotee therefore eats only <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/prasada" class="d">pras&#257;da</a>,</span> or foodstuffs offered to the Supreme Lord, and <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> says that when a devotee offers Him foodstuffs from the vegetable kingdom, with devotion, He eats that. A devotee is to offer to <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> foodstuffs prepared from vegetables. If the Supreme Lord wanted foodstuffs prepared from animal food, the devotee could offer this, but He does not order to do that.</div>
<A NAME="44542"></A><div id="44542"> </div>
<div class="Purport">We have to commit violence; that is a natural law. We should not, however, commit violence extravagantly, but only as much as ordered by the Lord. <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> engaged in the art of killing, and although killing is, of course, violence, he killed the enemy simply on K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s order. In the same way, if we commit violence as it is necessary, by the order of the Lord, that is called <span class="Italic">n&#257;tihi&#7745;s&#257;.</span> We cannot avoid violence, for we are put into a conditional life in which we have to commit violence, but we should not commit more violence than necessary or than ordered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
