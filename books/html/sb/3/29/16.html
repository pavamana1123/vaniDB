<div class="Translation">The devotee should regularly see My statues in the temple, touch My lotus feet and offer worshipable paraphernalia and prayer. He should see in the spirit of renunciation, from the mode of goodness, and see every living entity as spiritual.</div>

<div class="First">Temple worship is one of the duties of a devotee. It is especially recommended for neophytes, but those who are advanced should not refrain from temple worship. There is a distinction in the manner a neophyte and an advanced devotee appreciate the Lord&rsquo;s presence in the temple. A neophyte considers the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/arca" class="d">arc&#257;</a>-<a href="/d/vigraha" class="d">vigraha</a></span> (the statue of the Lord) to be different from the original Personality of Godhead; he considers it a representation of the Supreme Lord in the form of a Deity. But an advanced devotee accepts the Deity in the temple as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He does not see any difference between the original form of the Lord and the statue, or <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/arca" class="d">arc&#257;</a></span> form of the Lord, in the temple. This is the vision of a devotee whose devotional service is in the highest stage of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhava" class="d">bh&#257;va</a>,</span> or love of Godhead, whereas a neophyte&rsquo;s worship in the temple is a matter of routine duty.</div>
<A NAME="44556"></A><div id="44556"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Temple Deity worship is one of the functions of a devotee. He goes regularly to see the Deity nicely decorated, and with veneration and respect he touches the lotus feet of the Lord and presents offerings of worship, such as fruits, flowers and prayers. At the same time, to advance in devotional service, a devotee should see other living entities as spiritual sparks, parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord. A devotee is to offer respect to every entity that has a relationship with the Lord. Because every living entity originally has a relationship with the Lord as part and parcel, a devotee should try to see all living entities on the same equal level of spiritual existence. As stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a>,</span> a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/pandita" class="d">pa&#7751;&#7693;ita</a>,</span> one who is learned, sees equally a very learned <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a>,</span> a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sudra" class="d">&#347;&#363;dra</a>,</span> a hog, a dog and a cow. He does not see the body, which is only an outward dress. He does not see the dress of a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a>,</span> or that of a cow or of a hog. He sees the spiritual spark, part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. If a devotee does not see every living entity as part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, he is considered <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/prakrta" class="d">pr&#257;k&#7771;ta</a>-<a href="/d/bhakta" class="d">bhakta</a>,</span> a materialistic devotee. He is not completely situated on the spiritual platform; rather, he is in the lowest stage of devotion. He does, however, show all respect to the Deity.</div>
<A NAME="44557"></A><div id="44557"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Although a devotee sees all living entities on the level of spiritual existence, he is not interested in associating with everyone. Simply because a tiger is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord does not mean that we embrace him because of his spiritual relationship with the Supreme Lord. We must associate only with persons who have developed <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness.</div>
<A NAME="44558"></A><div id="44558"> </div>
<div class="Purport">We should befriend and offer special respect to persons who are developed in <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness. Other living entities are undoubtedly part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, but because their consciousness is still covered and not developed in <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness, we should renounce their association. It is said by Vi&#347;van&#257;tha <a href="/d/cakravarti" class="d">Cakravart&#299;</a> &#7788;h&#257;kura that even if one is a <a href="/d/vaisnava" class="d">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava</a>, if he is not of good character his company should be avoided, although he may be offered the respect of a <a href="/d/vaisnava" class="d">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava</a>. Anyone who accepts <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a> as the Supreme Personality of Godhead is accepted as a <a href="/d/vaisnava" class="d">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava</a>, but a <a href="/d/vaisnava" class="d">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava</a> is expected to develop all the good qualities of the demigods.</div>
<A NAME="44559"></A><div id="44559"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The exact meaning of the word <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sattvena" class="d">sattvena</a></span> is given by &#346;r&#299;dhara <a href="/d/svami" class="d">Sv&#257;m&#299;</a> as being synonymous with <span class="Italic">dhairye&#7751;a,</span> or patience. One must perform devotional service with great patience. One should not give up the execution of devotional service because one or two attempts have not been successful. One must continue. &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/rupa" class="d">R&#363;pa</a> Gosv&#257;m&#299; also confirms that one should be very enthusiastic and execute devotional service with patience and confidence. Patience is necessary for developing the confidence that &ldquo;K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a will certainly accept me because I am engaging in devotional service.&rdquo; One has only to execute service according to the rules and regulations to insure success.</div>
