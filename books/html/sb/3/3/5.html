<div class="Translation">Just to please His dear wife, the Lord brought back the p&#257;rij&#257;ta tree from heaven, just as an ordinary husband would do. But <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a>, the King of heaven, induced by his wives (henpecked as he was), ran after the Lord with full force to fight Him.</div>
<A NAME="29636"></A><div id="29636"> </div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<A NAME="29637"></A><div id="29637"> </div>
<div class="First">The Lord once went to the heavenly planet to present an earring to Aditi, the mother of the demigods, and His wife <a href="/d/satyabhama" class="d">Satyabh&#257;m&#257;</a> also went with Him. There is a special flowering tree called the <span class="Italic">p&#257;rij&#257;ta,</span> which grows only in the heavenly planets, and <a href="/d/satyabhama" class="d">Satyabh&#257;m&#257;</a> wanted this tree. Just to please His wife, like an ordinary husband, the Lord brought back the tree, and this enraged <a href="/d/vajri" class="d">Vajr&#299;</a>, or the controller of the thunderbolt. cause he was a henpecked husband and also a fool, listened to them and dared to fight with <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. He was a fool on this occasion because he forgot that everything belongs to the Lord.</div>
<A NAME="29638"></A><div id="29638"> </div>
<div class="Purport">There was no fault on the part of the Lord, even though He took away the tree from the heavenly kingdom, but because <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a> was henpecked, dominated by his beautiful wives like &#346;ac&#299;, he became a fool, just as all persons who are dominated by their wives are generally foolish. <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a> thought that <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> was a henpecked husband who only by the will of His wife <a href="/d/satyabhama" class="d">Satyabh&#257;m&#257;</a> took away the property of heaven, and therefore he thought that <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> could be punished. He forgot that the Lord is the proprietor of everything and cannot be henpecked. The Lord is fully independent, and by His will only He can have hundreds and thousands of wives like <a href="/d/satyabhama" class="d">Satyabh&#257;m&#257;</a>. He was not, therefore, attached to <a href="/d/satyabhama" class="d">Satyabh&#257;m&#257;</a> because she was a beautiful wife, but He was pleased with her devotional service and thus wanted to reciprocate the unalloyed devotion of His devotee.</div>
