<div class="Translation">&#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; informed the King that <a href="/d/uddhava" class="d">Uddhava</a>, being thus instructed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the source of all Vedic knowledge and the spiritual master of the three worlds, reached the pilgrimage <a href="/d/site" class="d">site</a> of Badarik&#257;&#347;rama and engaged himself there in trance to satisfy the Lord.</div>
<A NAME="30369"></A><div id="30369"> </div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<A NAME="30370"></A><div id="30370"> </div>
<div class="First">Lord &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is factually the spiritual master of the three worlds, and He is the original source of all Vedic knowledge. It is very difficult, however, to understand the personal feature of the Absolute Truth, even from the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> His personal instructions are needed in order to understand the Personality of Godhead as the Supreme Absolute Truth. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> is the evidence of such transcendental knowledge in gist. One cannot know the Supreme Lord unless one is graced by the Lord Himself. Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> exhibited this specific mercy towards <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> and <a href="/d/uddhava" class="d">Uddhava</a> while He was in the material world.</div>
<A NAME="30371"></A><div id="30371"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Undoubtedly <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> was spoken by the Lord on the Battlefield of <a href="/d/kuruksetra" class="d">Kuruk&#7779;etra</a> just to encourage <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> to fight, and yet to complete the transcendental knowledge of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a>,</span> the Lord instructed <a href="/d/uddhava" class="d">Uddhava</a>. The Lord wanted <a href="/d/uddhava" class="d">Uddhava</a> to fulfill His mission and disseminate knowledge which He had not spoken even in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a>.</span> Persons who are attached to the words of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> may also know from this verse that the Lord is the source of all Vedic knowledge. One who is unable to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by going through the pages of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> may take shelter of one of the Lord&rsquo;s devotees, such as <a href="/d/uddhava" class="d">Uddhava</a>, in order to advance further in knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahma</a>-<a href="/d/samhita" class="d">sa&#7745;hit&#257;</a></span> says that it is very difficult to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead from the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> but He is easily understood from a pure devotee like <a href="/d/uddhava" class="d">Uddhava</a>. Taking mercy on the great sages who lived at Badarik&#257;&#347;rama, the Lord authorized <a href="/d/uddhava" class="d">Uddhava</a> to speak on His behalf. Unless one has such authorization, one cannot understand or preach the devotional service of the Lord.</div>
<A NAME="30372"></A><div id="30372"> </div>
<div class="Purport">While present on this earth, the Lord executed many uncommon activities, even traveling in space to bring down the <span class="Italic">p&#257;rij&#257;ta</span> from heaven and recovering the son of His teacher (S&#257;nd&#299;pani <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a>) from the regions of death. <a href="/d/uddhava" class="d">Uddhava</a> was certainly informed of the conditions of life on other planets, and all the sages were anxious to know of them, just as we are anxious to know about the planets in space. <a href="/d/uddhava" class="d">Uddhava</a> was particularly deputed to carry a message to Badarik&#257;&#347;rama, not only to the sages of that place of pilgrimage but also to the <a href="/d/nara" class="d">Nara</a>-<a href="/d/narayana" class="d">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</a> Deities. Such a message must have been more confidential than the knowledge described in the pages of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span></div>
<A NAME="30373"></A><div id="30373"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The Lord is undoubtedly the source of all knowledge, and the messages dispatched through <a href="/d/uddhava" class="d">Uddhava</a> to <a href="/d/nara" class="d">Nara</a>-<a href="/d/narayana" class="d">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</a> and other sages were also part of the Vedic knowledge, but they were more confidential and could be sent or understood only through such a pure devotee as <a href="/d/uddhava" class="d">Uddhava</a>. Since such confidential knowledge was known only to the Lord and <a href="/d/uddhava" class="d">Uddhava</a>, it is said that <a href="/d/uddhava" class="d">Uddhava</a> was as good as the Lord Himself. Every living entity can, like <a href="/d/uddhava" class="d">Uddhava</a>, also become a confidential messenger on the same level as the Lord, provided he becomes confidential himself by dint of loving devotional service. Such confidential knowledge is entrusted, as confirmed in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> only to pure devotees like <a href="/d/uddhava" class="d">Uddhava</a> and <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a>, and one has to learn the mystery through them, and not otherwise. One cannot understand <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> or <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a></span> without the help of such confidential devotees of the Lord. According to &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha <a href="/d/cakravarti" class="d">Cakravart&#299;</a> &#7788;h&#257;kura, that confidential message must have concerned the mystery of His departure and the annihilation of His dynasty after the end of His appearance in the mundane world for one hundred years. Everyone must have been very anxious to know about the mystery of the annihilation of the <a href="/d/yadu" class="d">Yadu</a> dynasty, and that message must have been explained by the Lord to <a href="/d/uddhava" class="d">Uddhava</a> and dispatched to Badarik&#257;&#347;rama for the information of <a href="/d/nara" class="d">Nara</a>-<a href="/d/narayana" class="d">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</a> and other pure devotees of the Lord.</div>
