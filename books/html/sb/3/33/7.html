<div class="Translation">Oh, how glorious are they whose tongues are chanting Your holy name! Even if born in the families of dog-eaters, such persons are worshipable. Persons who chant the holy name of Your Lordship must have executed all kinds of austerities and fire sacrifices and achieved all the good manners of the &#256;ryans. To be chanting the holy name of Your Lordship, they must have bathed at holy places of pilgrimage, studied the Vedas and fulfilled everything required.</div>

<div class="First">As it is stated in the previous verse, a person who has once offenselessly chanted the holy name of God becomes immediately eligible to perform Vedic sacrifices. One should not be astonished by this statement of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a>.</span> One should not disbelieve or think, &ldquo;How by chanting the holy name of the Lord can one become a holy man to be compared to the most elevated <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span>?&rdquo; To eradicate such doubts in the minds of unbelievers, this verse affirms that the stage of chanting of the holy name of the Lord is not sudden, but that the chanters have already performed all kinds of Vedic rituals and sacrifices. It is not very astounding, for no one in this life can chant the holy name of the Lord unless he has passed all lower stages, such as performing the Vedic ritualistic sacrifices, studying the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> and practicing good behavior like that of the &#256;ryans. All this must first have been done. Just as a student in a law class is to be understood to have already graduated from general education, anyone who is engaged in the chanting of the holy name of the Lord&mdash;<a href="/d/hare" class="d">Hare</a> <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, <a href="/d/hare" class="d">Hare</a> <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, <a href="/d/hare" class="d">Hare</a> Hare/ <a href="/d/hare" class="d">Hare</a> <a href="/d/rama" class="d">R&#257;ma</a>, <a href="/d/hare" class="d">Hare</a> <a href="/d/rama" class="d">R&#257;ma</a>, <a href="/d/rama" class="d">R&#257;ma</a> R&#257;ma, <a href="/d/hare" class="d">Hare</a> Hare&mdash;must have already passed all lower stages. It is said that those who simply chant the holy name with the tip of the tongue are glorious. One does not even have to chant the holy name and understand the whole procedure, namely the offensive stage, offenseless stage and pure stage; if the holy name is sounded on the tip of the tongue, that is also sufficient. It is said herein that <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/nama" class="d">n&#257;ma</a>,</span> a singular number, one name, <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> or <a href="/d/rama" class="d">R&#257;ma</a>, is sufficient. It is not that one has to chant all the holy names of the Lord. The holy names of the Lord are innumerable, and one does not have to chant all the names to prove that he has already undergone all the processes of Vedic ritualistic ceremonies. If one chants once only, it is to be understood that he has already passed all the examinations, not to speak of those who are chanting always, twenty-four hours a day. It is specifically said here, <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/tubhyam" class="d">tubhyam</a>:</span> &ldquo;unto You only.&rdquo; One must chant God&rsquo;s name, not, as the <a href="/d/mayavadi" class="d">M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;</a> philosophers say, any name, such as a demigod&rsquo;s name or the names of God&rsquo;s energies. Only the holy name of the Supreme Lord will be effective. Anyone who compares the holy name of the Supreme Lord to the names of the demigods is called <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/pasandi" class="d">p&#257;&#7779;a&#7751;&#7693;&#299;</a>,</span> or an offender.</div>
<A NAME="46695"></A><div id="46695"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The holy name has to be chanted to please the Supreme Lord, and not for any sense gratification or professional purpose. If this pure mentality is there, then even though a person is born of a low family, such as a dog-eater&rsquo;s, he is so glorious that not only has he purified himself, but he is quite competent to deliver others. He is competent to speak on the importance of the transcendental name, just as &#7788;h&#257;kura <a href="/d/haridasa" class="d">Harid&#257;sa</a> did. He was apparently born in a family of Muhammadans, but because he was chanting the holy name of the Supreme Lord offenselessly, Lord <a href="/d/caitanya" class="d">Caitanya</a> empowered him to become the authority, or <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/acarya" class="d">&#257;c&#257;rya</a>,</span> of spreading the name. It did not matter that he was born in a family which was not following the Vedic rules and regulations. <a href="/d/caitanya" class="d">Caitanya</a> <a href="/d/mahaprabhu" class="d">Mah&#257;prabhu</a> and <a href="/d/advaita" class="d">Advaita</a> <a href="/d/prabhu" class="d">Prabhu</a> accepted him as an authority because he was offenselessly chanting the name of the Lord. Authorities like <a href="/d/advaita" class="d">Advaita</a> <a href="/d/prabhu" class="d">Prabhu</a> and Lord <a href="/d/caitanya" class="d">Caitanya</a> immediately accepted that he had already performed all kinds of austerities, studied the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> and performed all sacrifices. That is automatically understood. There is a hereditary class of <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> called the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/smarta" class="d">sm&#257;rta</a>-br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> however, who are of the opinion that even if such persons who are chanting the holy name of the Lord are accepted as purified, they still have to perform the Vedic rites or await their next birth in a family of <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> so that they can perform the Vedic rituals. But actually that is not the case. Such a man does not need to wait for the next birth to become purified. He is at once purified. It is understood that he has already performed all sorts of rites. It is the so-called <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> who actually have to undergo different kinds of austerities before reaching that point of purification. There are many other Vedic performances which are not described here. All such Vedic rituals have been already performed by the chanters of the holy name.</div>
<A NAME="46696"></A><div id="46696"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/juhuvuh" class="d">juhuvu&#7717;</a></span> means that the chanters of the holy name have already performed all kinds of sacrifices. <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sasnuh" class="d">Sasnu&#7717;</a></span> means that they have already traveled to all the holy places of pilgrimage and taken part in purificatory activities at those places. They are called <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/aryah" class="d">&#257;ry&#257;&#7717;</a></span> because they have already finished all these requirements, and therefore they must be among the &#256;ryans or those who have qualified themselves to become &#256;ryans. &ldquo;&#256;ryan&rdquo; refers to those who are civilized, whose manners are regulated according to the Vedic rituals. Any devotee who is chanting the holy name of the Lord is the best kind of &#256;ryan. Unless one studies the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> one cannot become an &#256;ryan, but it is automatically understood that the chanters have already studied all the Vedic literature. The specific word used here is <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/anucuh" class="d">an&#363;cu&#7717;</a>,</span> which means that because they have already completed all those recommended acts, they have become qualified to be spiritual masters.</div>
<A NAME="46697"></A><div id="46697"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The very word <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/grnanti" class="d">g&#7771;&#7751;anti</a>,</span> which is used in this verse, means to be already established in the perfectional stage of ritualistic performances. If one is seated on the bench of a high court and is giving judgment on cases, it means that he has already passed all legal exams and is better than those who are engaged in the study of law or those expecting to study law in the future. In a similar way, persons who are chanting the holy name are transcendental to those who are factually performing the Vedic rituals and those who expect to be qualified (or, in other words, those who are born in families of <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> but have not yet undergone the reformatory processes and who therefore expect to study the Vedic rituals and perform the sacrifices in the future).</div>
<A NAME="46698"></A><div id="46698"> </div>
<div class="Purport">There are many Vedic statements in different places saying that anyone who chants the holy name of the Lord becomes immediately freed from conditional life and that anyone who hears the holy name of the Lord, even though born of a family of dog-eaters, also becomes liberated from the clutches of material entanglement.</div>
