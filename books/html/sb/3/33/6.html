<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<A NAME="46675"></A><div id="46675"> </div>
<div class="Translation">To say nothing of the spiritual advancement of persons who see the Supreme Person face to face, even a person born in a family of dog-eaters immediately becomes eligible to perform Vedic sacrifices if he once utters the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead or chants about Him, hears about His pastimes, offers Him obeisances or even remembers Him.</div>
<A NAME="46676"></A><div id="46676"> </div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<A NAME="46677"></A><div id="46677"> </div>
<div class="First">Herein the spiritual potency of chanting, hearing or remembering the holy name of the Supreme Lord is greatly stressed. <a href="/d/rupa" class="d">R&#363;pa</a> Gosv&#257;m&#299; has discussed the sequence of sinful activities of the conditioned soul, and he has established, in <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">Bhakti</a>-<a href="/d/rasamrta" class="d">ras&#257;m&#7771;ta</a>-<a href="/d/sindhu" class="d">sindhu</a>,</span> that those who engage in devotional service become freed from the reactions of all sinful activities. This is also confirmed in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a>.</span> The Lord says that He takes charge of one who surrenders unto Him, and He makes him immune to all reactions to sinful activities. If by chanting the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead one becomes so swiftly cleared of all reactions to sinful activities, then what is to be said of those persons who see Him face to face?</div>
<A NAME="46678"></A><div id="46678"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Another consideration here is that persons who are purified by the process of chanting and hearing become immediately eligible to perform Vedic sacrifices. Generally, only a person who is born in a family of <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> who has been reformed by the ten kinds of purificatory processes and who is learned in Vedic literature is allowed to perform the Vedic sacrifices. But here the word <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sadyah" class="d">sadya&#7717;</a>,</span> &ldquo;immediately,&rdquo; is used, and &#346;r&#299;dhara <a href="/d/svami" class="d">Sv&#257;m&#299;</a> also remarks that one can <span class="Italic">immediately</span> become eligible to perform Vedic sacrifices. A person born in a family of the low <a href="/d/caste" class="d">caste</a> which is accustomed to eat dogs is so positioned due to his past sinful activities, but by chanting or hearing once in pureness, or in an offenseless manner, he is immediately relieved of the sinful reaction. Not only is he relieved of the sinful reaction, but he immediately achieves the result of all purificatory processes. Taking birth in the family of a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> is certainly due to pious activities in one&rsquo;s past life. But still a child who is born in a family of a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> depends for his further reformation upon initiation into acceptance of a sacred thread and many other reformatory processes. But a person who chants the holy name of the Lord, even if born in a family of <span class="Italic">ca&#7751;&#7693;&#257;las,</span> dog-eaters, does not need reformation. Simply by chanting <a href="/d/hare" class="d">Hare</a> <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, he immediately becomes purified and becomes as good as the most learned <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a>.</span></div>
<A NAME="46679"></A><div id="46679"> </div>
<div class="Purport">&#346;r&#299;dhara <a href="/d/svami" class="d">Sv&#257;m&#299;</a> especially remarks in this connection, <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/anena" class="d">anena</a> p&#363;jyatva&#7745; <a href="/d/laksyate" class="d">lak&#7779;yate</a>.</span> Some <a href="/d/caste" class="d">caste</a> <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> remark that by chanting <a href="/d/hare" class="d">Hare</a> <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, purification <span class="Italic">begins.</span> Of course, that depends on the individual process of chanting, but this remark of &#346;r&#299;dhara Sv&#257;m&#299;&rsquo;s is completely applicable if one chants the holy name of the Lord without offense, for he immediately becomes more than a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a>.</span> As &#346;r&#299;dhara <a href="/d/svami" class="d">Sv&#257;m&#299;</a> says, <span class="Italic">p&#363;jyatvam:</span> he immediately becomes as respectable as a most learned <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> and can be allowed to perform Vedic sacrifices. If simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord one becomes sanctified instantly, then what can be said of those persons who see the Supreme Lord face to face and who understand the descent of the Lord, as <a href="/d/devahuti" class="d">Devah&#363;ti</a> understands Kapiladeva.</div>
<A NAME="46680"></A><div id="46680"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Usually, initiation depends on the bona fide spiritual master, who directs the disciple. If he sees that a disciple has become competent and purified by the process of chanting, he offers the sacred thread to the disciple just so that he will be recognized as one-hundred-percent equal with a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a>.</span> This is also confirmed in the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/hari" class="d">Hari</a>-<a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">bhakti</a>-<a href="/d/vilasa" class="d">vil&#257;sa</a></span> by &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/sanatana" class="d">San&#257;tana</a> Gosv&#257;m&#299;: &ldquo;As a base metal like bell metal can be changed into gold by a chemical process, any person can similarly be changed into a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> by <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/diksa" class="d">d&#299;k&#7779;&#257;</a>-<a href="/d/vidhana" class="d">vidh&#257;na</a>,</span> the initiation process&rdquo;.</div>
<A NAME="46681"></A><div id="46681"> </div>
<div class="Purport">It is sometimes remarked that by the chanting process one begins to purify himself and can take birth in his next life in a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> family and then be reformed. But at this present moment, even those who are born in the best <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> families are not reformed, nor is there any certainty that they are actually born of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> fathers. Formerly the <span class="Italic">garbh&#257;dh&#257;na</span> reformatory system was prevalent, but at the present moment there is no such <span class="Italic">garbh&#257;dh&#257;na,</span> or seed-giving ceremony. Under these circumstances, no one knows if a man is factually born of a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> father. Whether one has acquired the qualification of a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> depends on the judgment of the bona fide spiritual master. He bestows upon the disciple the position of a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> by his own judgment. When one is accepted as a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> in the sacred thread ceremony under the <span class="Italic">p&#257;&ntilde;car&#257;trika</span> system, then he is <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/dvija" class="d">dvija</a>,</span> twice-born. That is confirmed by <a href="/d/sanatana" class="d">San&#257;tana</a> Gosv&#257;m&#299;: <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/dvijatvam" class="d">dvijatva&#7745;</a> <a href="/d/jayate" class="d">j&#257;yate</a>.</span> By the process of initiation by the spiritual master, a person is accepted as a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> in his purified state of chanting the holy name of the Lord. He then makes further progress to become a qualified <a href="/d/vaisnava" class="d">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava</a>, which means that the brahminical qualification is already acquired.</div>
