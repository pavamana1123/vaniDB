<div class="After-Verse">A conditioned soul is absorbed in material existence under the influence of different modes of external energy. Absorbed in the false ego, he thinks that he is doing everything by himself. The external energy of the Lord, the material nature, is fully under the control of the Supreme Lord, and the conditioned soul is fully under the grip of the external energy. Therefore, the conditioned soul is fully under the control of the law of the Lord. But, due to illusion only, he thinks himself independent in his activities. Duryodhana was acting under such influence of the external nature, by which he would be vanquished at the ultimate end. He could not accept the sound advice of <a href="/d/vidura" class="d">Vidura</a>, but on the contrary he insulted that great soul, who was the well-wisher of his whole family. <a href="/d/vidura" class="d">Vidura</a> could understand this because he was a pure devotee of the Lord. In spite of being very strongly insulted by Duryodhana&rsquo;s words, <a href="/d/vidura" class="d">Vidura</a> could see that Duryodhana, under the influence of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/maya" class="d">m&#257;y&#257;</a>,</span> the external energy, was making progress on the path toward his own ruination. He therefore considered the acts of the external energy to be supreme, yet he also saw how the internal energy of the Lord helped him in that particular situation. A devotee is always in a renounced temperament because the worldly attractions can never satisfy him. <a href="/d/vidura" class="d">Vidura</a> was never attracted by the royal palace of his brother. He was always ready to leave the place and devote himself completely to the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Now he got the opportunity by the grace of Duryodhana, and instead of being sorry at the strong words of insult, he thanked him from within because it gave him the chance to live alone in a holy place and fully engage in the devotional service of the Lord. The word <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/gata" class="d">gata</a>-<a href="/d/vyathah" class="d">vyatha&#7717;</a></span> (without being sorry) is significant here because <a href="/d/vidura" class="d">Vidura</a> was relieved from the tribulations which trouble every man entangled in material activities. He therefore thought that there was no need to defend his brother with his bow because his brother was meant for ruination. Thus he left the palace before Duryodhana could act. <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/maya" class="d">M&#257;y&#257;</a>,</span> the supreme energy of the Lord, acted here both internally and externally.</div>
