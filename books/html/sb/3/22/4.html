<div class="Translation">That is why the br&#257;hma&#7751;as and k&#7779;atriyas protect each other, as well as themselves; and the Lord Himself, who is both the cause and effect and is yet immutable, protects them through each other.</div>

<div class="First">The entire social structure of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/varna" class="d">var&#7751;a</a></span> and <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/asrama" class="d">&#257;&#347;rama</a></span> is a cooperative system meant to uplift all to the highest platform of spiritual realization. The <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> are intended to be protected by the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas,</span> and the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas</span> also are intended to be enlightened by the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as.</span> When the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas</span> cooperate nicely, the other subordinate divisions, the <span class="Italic">vai&#347;yas,</span> or mercantile people, and the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras,</span> or laborer class, automatically flourish. The entire elaborate system of Vedic society was therefore based on the importance of the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas.</span> The Lord is the real protector, but He is unattached to the affairs of protection. He creates <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> for the protection of the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas,</span> and <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas</span> for the protection of the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as.</span> He remains aloof from all activities; therefore, He is called <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/nirvikara" class="d">nirvik&#257;ra</a>,</span> &ldquo;without activity.&rdquo; He has nothing to do. He is so great that He does not perform action personally, but His energies act. The <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas,</span> and anything that we see, are different energies acting upon one another.</div>
<A NAME="39988"></A><div id="39988"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Although individual souls are all different, the Superself, or Supersoul, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Individually one&rsquo;s self may differ from others in certain qualities and may engage in different activities, such as those of a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a>, <a href="/d/ksatriya" class="d">k&#7779;atriya</a></span> or <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/vaisya" class="d">vai&#347;ya</a>,</span> but when there is complete cooperation among different individual souls, the Supreme Personality of Godhead as Supersoul, <a href="/d/paramatma" class="d">Param&#257;tm&#257;</a>, being one in every individual soul, is pleased and gives them all protection. As stated before, the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> are produced from the mouth of the Lord, and the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas</span> are produced from the chest or arms of the Lord. If the different castes or social sections, although apparently differently occupied in different activities, nevertheless act in full cooperation, then the Lord is pleased. This is the idea of the institution of four <span class="Italic">var&#7751;as</span> and four <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;ramas.</span> If the members of different <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;ramas</span> and <span class="Italic">var&#7751;as</span> cooperate fully in <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness, then society is well protected by the Lord, without doubt.</div>
<A NAME="39989"></A><div id="39989"> </div>
<div class="Purport">In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> it is stated that the Lord is the proprietor of all different bodies. The individual soul is the proprietor of his individual body, but the Lord clearly states, &ldquo;My dear <a href="/d/bharata" class="d">Bh&#257;rata</a>, you must know that I am also <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/ksetra" class="d">k&#7779;etra</a> <a href="/d/jna" class="d">j&ntilde;a</a>.</span> <span class="Italic">&rdquo;</span> <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/ksetra" class="d">K&#7779;etra</a> <a href="/d/jna" class="d">j&ntilde;a</a></span> means &ldquo;the knower or proprietor of the body.&rdquo; The individual soul is the proprietor of the individual body, but the Supersoul, the Personality of Godhead, <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, is the proprietor of all bodies everywhere. He is the proprietor not only of human bodies but of birds, beasts and all other entities, not only on this planet but on other planets also. He is the supreme proprietor; therefore He does not become divided by protecting the different individual souls. He remains one and the same. That the sun appears on top of everyone&rsquo;s head when at the meridian does not imply that the sun becomes divided. One man thinks that the sun is on his head only, whereas five thousand miles away another man is thinking that the sun is only on his head. Similarly, the Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is one, but He appears to individually oversee each individual soul. This does not mean that the individual soul and the Supersoul are one. They are one in quality, as spirit soul, but the individual soul and Supersoul are different.</div>
