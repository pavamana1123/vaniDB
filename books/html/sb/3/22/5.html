<div class="First"><a href="/d/manu" class="d">Manu</a> described herewith the result of seeing a great saintly person. Lord <a href="/d/caitanya" class="d">Caitanya</a> says that one should always try to associate with saintly persons because if one establishes a proper association with a saintly person, even for a moment, one attains all perfection. Somehow or other, if one meets a saintly person and achieves his favor, then the entire mission of one&rsquo;s human life is fulfilled. In our personal experience we have actual proof of this statement of <a href="/d/manu" class="d">Manu</a>. Once we had the opportunity to meet Vi&#7779;&#7751;up&#257;da &#346;r&#299; &#346;r&#299;mad Bhaktisiddh&#257;nta <a href="/d/sarasvati" class="d">Sarasvat&#299;</a> Gosv&#257;m&#299; <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a>, and on first sight he requested this humble self to preach his message in the Western countries. There was no preparation for this, but somehow or other he desired it, and by his grace we are now engaged in executing his order, which has given us a transcendental occupation and has saved and liberated us from the occupation of material activities. Thus it is actually a fact that if one meets a saintly person completely engaged in transcendental duties and achieves his favor, then one&rsquo;s life mission becomes complete. What is not possible to achieve in thousands of lives can be achieved in one moment if there is an opportunity to meet a saintly person. It is therefore enjoined in Vedic literature that one should always try to associate with saintly persons and try to disassociate oneself from the common man, because by one word of a saintly person one can be liberated from material entanglement. A saintly person has the power, because of his spiritual advancement, to give immediate liberation to the conditioned soul. Here <a href="/d/manu" class="d">Manu</a> admits that all his doubts are now over because <a href="/d/kardama" class="d">Kardama</a> has very kindly described the different duties of individual souls.</div>
