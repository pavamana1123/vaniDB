<div class="Translation">Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> begged pardon from His parents for Their [K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s and Balar&#257;ma&rsquo;s] inability to serve their feet, due to being away from home because of great fear of <a href="/d/kamsa" class="d">Ka&#7745;sa</a>. He said, &ldquo;O mother, O father, please excuse Us for this inability.&rdquo; All this behavior of the Lord gives me pain at heart.</div>
<A NAME="29339"></A><div id="29339"> </div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<A NAME="29340"></A><div id="29340"> </div>
<div class="First">It appears that Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> and <a href="/d/baladeva" class="d">Baladeva</a> were both very greatly afraid of <a href="/d/kamsa" class="d">Ka&#7745;sa</a>, and therefore They had to hide Themselves. But if Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> and <a href="/d/baladeva" class="d">Baladeva</a> are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, how was it possible that They were afraid of <a href="/d/kamsa" class="d">Ka&#7745;sa</a>? Is there any contradiction in such statements? <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">Vasudeva</a>, due to his great appreciation for <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, wanted to give Him protection. He never thought that <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> was the Supreme Lord and could protect Himself; he thought of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> as his son. Because <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">Vasudeva</a> was a great devotee of the Lord, he did not like to think that <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> might be killed like his other children. Morally, <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">Vasudeva</a> was bound to deliver <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> to the hands of <a href="/d/kamsa" class="d">Ka&#7745;sa</a> because he had promised to turn over all his children. But out of his great love for <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> he broke his promise, and the Lord was very pleased with <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">Vasudeva</a> for his transcendental mentality. He did not want to disturb the intense affection of <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">Vasudeva</a>, and thus He agreed to be carried by His father to the house of <a href="/d/nanda" class="d">Nanda</a> and <a href="/d/yasoda" class="d">Ya&#347;od&#257;</a>. And just to test the intense love of <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">Vasudeva</a>, Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> fell down in the waters of the <a href="/d/yamuna" class="d">Yamun&#257;</a> while His father was crossing the river. <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">Vasudeva</a> became <a href="/d/mad" class="d">mad</a> after his child as he tried to recover Him in the midst of the rising river.</div>
<A NAME="29341"></A><div id="29341"> </div>
<div class="Purport">These are all glorified pastimes of the Lord, and there is no contradiction in such manifestations. Since <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is the Supreme Lord, He was never afraid of <a href="/d/kamsa" class="d">Ka&#7745;sa</a>, but to please His father He agreed to be so. And the most brilliant part of His supreme character was that He begged pardon from His parents for being unable to serve their feet while absent from home because of fear of <a href="/d/kamsa" class="d">Ka&#7745;sa</a>. The Lord, whose lotus feet are worshiped by demigods like <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> and &#346;iva, wanted to worship the feet of <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">Vasudeva</a>. Such instruction by the Lord to the world is quite appropriate. Even if one is the Supreme Lord, one must serve his parents. A son is indebted to his parents in so many ways, and it is the duty of the son to serve his parents, however great the son may be. Indirectly, <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> wanted to teach the atheists who do not accept the supreme fatherhood of God, and they may learn from this action how much the Supreme Father has to be respected. <a href="/d/uddhava" class="d">Uddhava</a> was simply struck with wonder by such glorious behavior of the Lord, and he was very sorry that he was unable to go with Him.</div>
