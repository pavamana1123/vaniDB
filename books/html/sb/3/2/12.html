<div class="Translation">The Lord appeared in the mortal world by His internal potency, <a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a>-<a href="/d/maya" class="d">m&#257;y&#257;</a>. He came in His eternal form, which is just suitable for His pastimes. These pastimes were wonderful for everyone, even for those proud of their own opulence, including the Lord Himself in His form as the Lord of <a href="/d/vaikuntha" class="d">Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha</a>. Thus His [&#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s] transcendental body is the ornament of all ornaments.</div>
<A NAME="29270"></A><div id="29270"> </div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<A NAME="29271"></A><div id="29271"> </div>
<div class="First">In conformity with the Vedic hymns (<span class="Italic">nityo nity&#257;n&#257;&#7745; cetana&#347; cetan&#257;n&#257;m</span>), the Personality of Godhead is more excellent than all other living beings within all the universes in the material world. He is the chief of all living entities; no one can surpass Him or be equal to Him in wealth, strength, fame, beauty, knowledge or renunciation. When Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> was within this universe, He seemed to be a human being because He appeared in a manner just suitable for His pastimes in the mortal world. He did not appear in human society in His <a href="/d/vaikuntha" class="d">Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha</a> feature with four hands because that would not have been suitable for His pastimes. But in spite of His appearing as a human being, no one was or is equal to Him in any respect in any of the six different opulences. Everyone is more or less proud of his opulence in this world, but when Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> was in human society, He excelled all His contemporaries within the universe.</div>
<A NAME="29272"></A><div id="29272"> </div>
<div class="Purport">When the Lord&rsquo;s pastimes are visible to the human eye, they are called <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/prakata" class="d">praka&#7789;a</a>,</span> and when they are not visible they are called <span class="Italic">apraka&#7789;a.</span> In fact, the Lord&rsquo;s pastimes never stop, just as the sun never leaves the sky. The sun is always in its right orbit in the sky, but it is sometimes visible and sometimes invisible to our limited vision. Similarly, the pastimes of the Lord are always current in one universe or another, and when Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> disappeared from the transcendental abode of <a href="/d/dvaraka" class="d">Dv&#257;rak&#257;</a>, it was simply a disappearance from the eyes of the people there. It should not be misunderstood that His transcendental body, which is just suitable for the pastimes in the mortal world, is in any way inferior to His different expansions in the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;halokas. His body manifested in the material world is transcendental par excellence in the sense that His pastimes in the mortal world excel His mercy displayed in the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;halokas. In the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;halokas the Lord is merciful toward the liberated or <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/nitya" class="d">nitya</a>-<a href="/d/mukta" class="d">mukta</a></span> living entities, but in His pastimes in the mortal world He is merciful even to the fallen souls who are <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/nitya" class="d">nitya</a>-<a href="/d/baddha" class="d">baddha</a>,</span> or conditioned forever. The six excellent opulences which He displayed in the mortal world by the agency of His internal potency, <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a>-<a href="/d/maya" class="d">m&#257;y&#257;</a>,</span> are rare even in the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;halokas. All His pastimes were manifested not by the material energy but by His spiritual energy. The excellence of His <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/rasa" class="d">r&#257;sa</a>-<a href="/d/lila" class="d">l&#299;l&#257;</a></span> at <a href="/d/vrndavana" class="d">V&#7771;nd&#257;vana</a> and His householder life with sixteen thousand wives is wonderful even for <a href="/d/narayana" class="d">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</a> in <a href="/d/vaikuntha" class="d">Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha</a> and is certainly so for other living entities within this mortal world. His pastimes are wonderful even for other incarnations of the Lord, such as &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/rama" class="d">R&#257;ma</a>, <a href="/d/nrsimha" class="d">N&#7771;si&#7745;ha</a> and <a href="/d/varaha" class="d">Var&#257;ha</a>. His opulence was so superexcellent that His pastimes were adored even by the Lord of <a href="/d/vaikuntha" class="d">Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha</a>, who is not different from Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> Himself.</div>
