<div class="Translation">After showing his wife the globe of the universe and its different arrangements, full of many wonders, the great <a href="/d/yogi" class="d">yog&#299;</a> <a href="/d/kardama" class="d">Kardama</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> returned to his own hermitage.</div>

<div class="First">All the planets are here described as <span class="Italic">gola,</span> round. Every planet is round, and each planet is a different shelter, just like islands in the great ocean. Planets are sometimes called <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/dvipa" class="d">dv&#299;pa</a></span> or <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/varsa" class="d">var&#7779;a</a>.</span> This earth planet is called <a href="/d/bharata" class="d">Bh&#257;rata</a>-<a href="/d/varsa" class="d">var&#7779;a</a> because it was ruled by King <a href="/d/bharata" class="d">Bharata</a>. Another significant word used in this verse is <span class="Italic">bahv-<a href="/d/ascaryam" class="d">&#257;&#347;caryam</a>,</span> &ldquo;many wonderful things.&rdquo; This indicates that the different planets are distributed all over the universe in the eight directions, and each and every one of them is wonderful in itself. Each planet has its particular climatic influences and particular types of inhabitants and is completely equipped with everything, including the beauty of the seasons. In the <span class="Ref_Italic"><a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahma</a>-<a href="/d/samhita" class="d">sa&#7745;hit&#257;</a></span> (5.40) it is similarly stated, <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/vibhuti" class="d">vibh&#363;ti</a>-<a href="/d/bhinnam" class="d">bhinnam</a>:</span> on each and every planet there are different opulences. It cannot be expected that one planet is exactly like another. By God&rsquo;s grace, by nature&rsquo;s law, each and every planet is made differently and has different wonderful features. All such wonders were personally experienced by <a href="/d/kardama" class="d">Kardama</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> while he traveled with his wife, yet he could return again to his humble hermitage. He showed his princess-wife that although he was living in the hermitage, he had the power to go everywhere and do anything by mystic <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a>.</span> That is the perfection of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a>.</span> One cannot become a perfect <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yogi" class="d">yog&#299;</a></span> simply by showing some sitting postures, nor by such sitting postures or so-called meditation can one become God, as is being advertised. Foolish persons are misled into believing that simply by some caricature of meditation and sitting postures one can become God within six months.</div>
<A NAME="40965"></A><div id="40965"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Here is the example of a perfect <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yogi" class="d">yog&#299;</a>;</span> he could travel all over the universe. Similarly, there is a description of Durv&#257;s&#257; <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a>, who also traveled in space. Actually, the perfect <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yogi" class="d">yog&#299;</a></span> can do that. But even if one can travel all over the universe and show wonderful feats like <a href="/d/kardama" class="d">Kardama</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a>, he cannot be compared to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose power and inconceivable energy can never be attained by any conditioned or liberated soul. By the actions of <a href="/d/kardama" class="d">Kardama</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> we can understand that in spite of his immense mystic power, he remained a devotee of the Lord. That is the real position of every living entity.</div>
