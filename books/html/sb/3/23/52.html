<div class="Translation">My dear <a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a>, as far as your daughters are concerned, they will find their own suitable husbands and go away to their respective homes. But who will give me solace after your departure as a <a href="/d/sannyasi" class="d">sanny&#257;s&#299;</a>?<span class="Italic"></span></div>

<div class="First">It is said that the father himself becomes the son in another form. The father and son are therefore considered to be nondifferent. A widow who has her son is actually not a widow, because she has the representative of her husband. Similarly, <a href="/d/devahuti" class="d">Devah&#363;ti</a> is indirectly asking <a href="/d/kardama" class="d">Kardama</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> to leave a representative so that in his absence she might be relieved of her anxieties by a suitable son. A householder is not expected to remain at home for all his days. After getting his sons and daughters married, a householder can retire from household life, leaving his wife in the charge of the grown-up sons. That is the social convention of the Vedic system. <a href="/d/devahuti" class="d">Devah&#363;ti</a> is indirectly asking that in his absence from home there be at least one male child to give her relief from her anxieties. This relief means spiritual instruction. Relief does not mean material comforts. Material comforts will end with the end of the body, but spiritual instruction will not end; it will go on with the spirit soul. Instruction in spiritual advancement is necessary, but without having a worthy son, how could <a href="/d/devahuti" class="d">Devah&#363;ti</a> advance in spiritual knowledge? It is the duty of the husband to liquidate his debt to his wife. The wife gives her sincere service to the husband, and he becomes indebted to her because one cannot accept service from his subordinate without giving him something in exchange. The spiritual master cannot accept service from a disciple without awarding him spiritual instruction. That is the reciprocation of love and duty. Thus <a href="/d/devahuti" class="d">Devah&#363;ti</a> reminds her husband, <a href="/d/kardama" class="d">Kardama</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a>, that she has rendered him faithful service. Even considering the situation on the basis of liquidating his debt toward his wife, he must give a male child before he leaves. Indirectly, <a href="/d/devahuti" class="d">Devah&#363;ti</a> requests her husband to remain at home a few days more, or at least until a male child is born.</div>
