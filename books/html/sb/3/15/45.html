<div class="First">The success of the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> process is very nicely described here. It is specifically mentioned that the form of the Lord as four-handed <a href="/d/narayana" class="d">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</a> is the object of meditation for the followers of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a>-<a href="/d/marga" class="d">m&#257;rga</a>.</span> In the modern age there are so many so-called <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> who do not target their meditation on the four-handed <a href="/d/narayana" class="d">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</a> form. Some of them try to meditate on something impersonal or void, but that is not approved by the great <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> who follow the standard method. The real <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a>-<a href="/d/marga" class="d">m&#257;rga</a></span> process is to control the senses, sit in a solitary and sanctified place and meditate on the four-handed form of <a href="/d/narayana" class="d">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</a>, decorated as described in this chapter as He appeared before the four sages. This <a href="/d/narayana" class="d">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</a> form is K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s expansion; therefore the <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness movement which is now spreading is the real, topmost process of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> practice.</div>
<A NAME="36787"></A><div id="36787"> </div>
<div class="Purport"><a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness is the highest <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> performance by trained devotional <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s.</span> Despite all the allurement of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> practice, the eight kinds of yogic perfections are hardly achievable by the common man. But here it is described that the Lord, who appeared before the four sages, is Himself full of all eight of those perfections. The highest <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a>-<a href="/d/marga" class="d">m&#257;rga</a></span> process is to concentrate the mind twenty-four hours a day on <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. This is called <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness. The <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> system, as described in <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a></span> and <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> or as recommended in the Pata&ntilde;jali <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> process, is different from the nowadays-practiced <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/hatha" class="d">ha&#7789;ha</a>-<a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> as it is generally understood in the Western countries. Real <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> practice is to control the senses and, after such control is established, to concentrate the mind on the <a href="/d/narayana" class="d">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</a> form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is the original Personality of Godhead, and all the other <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a> forms&mdash;with four hands decorated with conch, lotus, club and wheel&mdash;are plenary expansions of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> it is recommended that one meditate upon the form of the Lord. To practice concentration of the mind, one has to sit with the head and the back in a straight line, and one must practice in a secluded place, sanctified by a sacred atmosphere. The <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yogi" class="d">yog&#299;</a></span> should observe the rules and regulations of <span class="Italic">brahmacarya</span>&mdash;to strictly live a life of self-restraint and celibacy. One cannot practice <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> in a congested city, living a life of extravagancy, including unrestricted sex indulgence and adultery of the tongue. <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">Yoga</a></span> practice necessitates controlling the senses, and the beginning of sense control is to control the tongue. One who can control the tongue can also have control over the other senses. One cannot allow the tongue to take all kinds of forbidden food and drink and at the same time advance in the practice of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a>.</span> It is a very regrettable fact that many unauthorized so-called <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> come to the Western countries and exploit people&rsquo;s inclination towards <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> practice. Such unauthorized <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> even <a href="/d/dare" class="d">dare</a> to say publicly that one can indulge in the habit of drinking and at the same time practice meditation.</div>

<div class="Purport">Five thousand years ago Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> recommended <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> practice to <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a>, but <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> frankly expressed his inability to follow the stringent rules and regulations of the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> system. One should be very practical in every field of activities and should not waste his valuable time in practicing useless gymnastic feats in the name of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a>.</span> Real <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> is to search out the four-handed Supersoul within one&rsquo;s heart and see Him perpetually in meditation. Such continued meditation is called <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/samadhi" class="d">sam&#257;dhi</a>,</span> and the object of this meditation is the four-handed <a href="/d/narayana" class="d">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</a>, with bodily decorations as described in this chapter of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a>.</span> If, however, one wants to meditate upon something void or impersonal, it will take a very long time before he achieves success in <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> practice. We cannot concentrate our mind on something void or impersonal. Real <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> is to fix the mind on the form of the Lord, the four-handed <a href="/d/narayana" class="d">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</a> who is sitting in everyone&rsquo;s heart.</div>
<A NAME="36789"></A><div id="36789"> </div>
<div class="Purport">By meditation one can understand that God is seated within one&rsquo;s heart. Even if one does not know it, God is seated within the heart of everyone. Not only is He seated in the heart of the human being, but He is also within the hearts of cats and dogs. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> certifies this fact by the declaration of the Lord, <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/isvarah" class="d">&#299;&#347;vara&#7717;</a> <a href="/d/sarva" class="d">sarva</a>-<a href="/d/bhutanam" class="d">bh&#363;t&#257;n&#257;&#7745;</a> <a href="/d/hrd" class="d">h&#7771;d</a>-<a href="/d/dese" class="d">de&#347;e</a></I> [Bg. </I><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/18/61?d=1">18.61</a></I>]</I>.</span> The <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/isvara" class="d">&#299;&#347;vara</a>,</span> the supreme controller of the world, is seated in the heart of everyone. Not only is He in everyone&rsquo;s heart, but He is also present within the atom. No place is vacant or devoid of the presence of the Lord. That is the statement of <span class="Italic">&#298;&#347;opani&#7779;ad.</span> God is present everywhere, and His right of proprietorship applies to everything. The feature of the Lord by which He is present everywhere is called <a href="/d/paramatma" class="d">Param&#257;tm&#257;</a>. <span class="Italic">&#256;tm&#257;</span> means the individual soul, and <a href="/d/paramatma" class="d">Param&#257;tm&#257;</a> means the individual Supersoul; both <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/atma" class="d">&#257;tm&#257;</a></span> and <a href="/d/paramatma" class="d">Param&#257;tm&#257;</a> are individual persons. The difference between <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/atma" class="d">&#257;tm&#257;</a></span> and <a href="/d/paramatma" class="d">Param&#257;tm&#257;</a> is that the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/atma" class="d">&#257;tm&#257;</a>,</span> or the soul, is present only in a particular body, whereas the <a href="/d/paramatma" class="d">Param&#257;tm&#257;</a> is present everywhere. In this connection, the example of the sun is very nice. An individual person may be situated in one place, but the sun, even though a similar individual entity, is present on the head of every individual person. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> this is explained. Therefore even though the qualities of all entities, including the Lord, are equal, the Supersoul is different from the individual soul by quantitative power of expansion. The Lord, or the Supersoul, can expand Himself into millions of different forms, whereas the individual soul cannot do so.</div>
<A NAME="36790"></A><div id="36790"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The Supersoul, being seated in everyone&rsquo;s heart, can witness everyone&rsquo;s activities&mdash;past, present and future. In the <span class="Italic">Upani&#7779;ads</span> the Supersoul is described as being seated with the individual soul as friend and witness. As a friend, the Lord is always anxious to get back His friend, the individual soul, and bring him back home, back to Godhead. As a witness He is the bestower of all benedictions, and He endows each individual with the result of his actions. The Supersoul gives the individual soul all facilities to achieve whatever he desires to enjoy in this material world. Suffering is a reaction to the living entity&rsquo;s propensity to try to lord it over the material world. But the Lord instructs His friend, the individual soul, who is also His son, to give up all other engagements and simply surrender unto Him for perpetual bliss and an eternal life full of knowledge. This is the last instruction of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a>,</span> the most authorized and widely read book on all varieties of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a>.</span> Thus the last word of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> is the last word in the perfection of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a>.</span></div>
<A NAME="36791"></A><div id="36791"> </div>
<div class="Purport">It is stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> that a person who is always absorbed in <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness is the topmost <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yogi" class="d">yog&#299;</a>.</span> What is <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness? As the individual soul is present by his consciousness throughout his entire body, so the Supersoul, or <a href="/d/paramatma" class="d">Param&#257;tm&#257;</a>, is present throughout the whole creation by superconsciousness. This superconscious energy is imitated by the individual soul, who has limited consciousness. I can understand what is going on within my limited body, but I cannot feel what is going on in another&rsquo;s body. I am present throughout my body by my consciousness, but my consciousness is not present in another&rsquo;s body. The Supersoul, or <a href="/d/paramatma" class="d">Param&#257;tm&#257;</a>, however, being present everywhere and within everyone, is also conscious of everyone&rsquo;s existence. The theory that the soul and the Supersoul are one is not acceptable because it is not confirmed by authoritative Vedic literature. The individual soul&rsquo;s consciousness cannot act in superconsciousness. This superconsciousness can be achieved, however, by dovetailing individual consciousness with the consciousness of the Supreme. This dovetailing process is called surrender, or <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness. From the teachings of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> we learn very clearly that <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a>, in the beginning, did not want to fight with his brothers and relatives, but after understanding <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> he dovetailed his consciousness with the superconsciousness of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. He was then in <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness.</div>
<A NAME="36792"></A><div id="36792"> </div>
<div class="Purport">A person in full <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness acts by the dictation of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. In the beginning of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness, dictation is received through the transparent medium of the spiritual master. When one is sufficiently trained and acts in submissive faith and love for <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> under the direction of the bona fide spiritual master, the dovetailing process becomes more firm and accurate. This stage of devotional service by the devotee in <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness is the most perfect stage of the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> system. At this stage, <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, or the Supersoul, dictates from within, while from without the devotee is helped by the spiritual master, who is the bona fide representative of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. From within He helps the devotee as <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/caitya" class="d">caitya</a>,</span> for He is seated within the heart of everyone. Understanding that God is seated within everyone&rsquo;s heart is not, however, sufficient. One has to be acquainted with God from both within and without, and one must take dictation from within and without to act in <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness. This is the highest perfectional stage of the human form of life and the topmost perfection of all <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a>.</span></div>

<div class="Purport">For a perfect <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yogi" class="d">yog&#299;</a>,</span> there are eight kinds of superachievements: one can become lighter than air, one can become smaller than the atom, one can become bigger than a mountain, one can achieve whatever he desires, one can control like the Lord, and so on. But when one rises to the perfectional stage of receiving dictation from the Lord, that is greater than any stage of material achievements above mentioned. The breathing exercise of the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> system which is generally practiced is just the beginning. Meditation on the Supersoul is just another step forward. But to obtain direct contact with the Supersoul and take dictation from Him is the highest perfectional stage. The breathing exercises of meditation practice were very difficult even five thousand years ago, otherwise <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> would not have rejected the proposal of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> that he adopt this system. This age of <a href="/d/kali" class="d">Kali</a> is called the fallen age. In this age, people in general are short-living and very slow to understand self-realization or spiritual life; they are mostly unfortunate, and therefore if someone is a little bit interested in self-realization he is likely to be misguided by so many frauds. The only way to realize the perfect stage of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> is to follow the principles of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> as practiced by Lord <a href="/d/caitanya" class="d">Caitanya</a>.

The meditation process was possible in the golden age, <a href="/d/satya" class="d">Satya</a>-<a href="/d/yuga" class="d">yuga</a>, because people in that age used to live for hundreds of thousands of years. If one wants success in practical <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> practice, it is advised that he take to the chanting of <a href="/d/hare" class="d">Hare</a> <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, <a href="/d/hare" class="d">Hare</a> <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, <a href="/d/hare" class="d">Hare</a> Hare/ <a href="/d/hare" class="d">Hare</a> <a href="/d/rama" class="d">R&#257;ma</a>, <a href="/d/hare" class="d">Hare</a> <a href="/d/rama" class="d">R&#257;ma</a>, <a href="/d/rama" class="d">R&#257;ma</a> R&#257;ma, <a href="/d/hare" class="d">Hare</a> Hare, and he will actually feel himself making progress. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> this practice of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness is prescribed as <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/raja" class="d">r&#257;ja</a>-<a href="/d/vidya" class="d">vidy&#257;</a>,</span> or the king of all erudition.</div>

<div class="Purport">Those who have taken to this most sublime <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">bhakti</a>-<a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> system, who practice devotional service in transcendental love of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, can testify to its happy and easy execution. The four sages <a href="/d/sanaka" class="d">Sanaka</a>, <a href="/d/sanatana" class="d">San&#257;tana</a>, <a href="/d/sanandana" class="d">Sanandana</a> and <a href="/d/sanat" class="d">Sanat</a>-<a href="/d/kumara" class="d">kum&#257;ra</a> also became attracted by the features of the Lord and the transcendental aroma of the dust of His lotus feet, as already described in verse 43.</div>

<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">Yoga</a></span> necessitates controlling the senses, and <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">bhakti</a>-<a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a>,</span> or <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness, is the process of purifying the senses. When the senses are purified, they are automatically controlled. One cannot stop the activities of the senses by artificial means, but if one purifies the senses by engaging in the service of the Lord, the senses not only can be controlled from rubbish engagement, but can be engaged in the Lord&rsquo;s transcendental service, as aspired to by the four sages <a href="/d/sanaka" class="d">Sanaka</a>, <a href="/d/sanatana" class="d">San&#257;tana</a>, <a href="/d/sanandana" class="d">Sanandana</a> and <a href="/d/sanat" class="d">Sanat</a>-<a href="/d/kumara" class="d">kum&#257;ra</a>. <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness is not, therefore, a manufactured concoction of the speculative mind.
