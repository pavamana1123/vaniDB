<div class="First">According to the Vedic system, a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sannyasi" class="d">sanny&#257;s&#299;</a>,</span> a person in the renounced order of life, is dressed in saffron-colored garments. This saffron dress is practically a passport for the mendicant and <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sannyasi" class="d">sanny&#257;s&#299;</a></span> to go anywhere. The <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;&rsquo;s</span> duty is to enlighten people in <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness. Those in the renounced order of life have no other business but preaching the glories and supremacy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the Vedic sociological conception is that a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sannyasi" class="d">sanny&#257;s&#299;</a></span> should not be restricted; he is allowed to go anywhere and everywhere he wants, and he is not refused any gift he might demand from a householder. The four Kum&#257;ras came to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead <a href="/d/narayana" class="d">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</a>. The word <span class="Italic">suh&#7771;ttama,</span> &ldquo;best of all friends,&rdquo; is important. As Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> states in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a>,</span> He is the best friend of all living entities. <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/suhrdam" class="d">Suh&#7771;da&#7745;</a> <a href="/d/sarva" class="d">sarva</a>-<a href="/d/bhutanam" class="d">bh&#363;t&#257;n&#257;m</a>.</span> No one can be a greater well-wishing friend to any living entity than the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is so kindly disposed towards everyone that in spite of our completely forgetting our relationship with the Supreme Lord, He comes Himself&mdash;sometimes personally, as Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> appeared on this earth, and sometimes as His devotee, as did Lord <a href="/d/caitanya" class="d">Caitanya</a> <a href="/d/mahaprabhu" class="d">Mah&#257;prabhu</a>&mdash;and sometimes He sends His bona fide devotees to reclaim all the fallen souls. Therefore, He is the greatest well-wishing friend of everyone, and the Kum&#257;ras wanted to see Him. The doorkeepers should have known that the four sages had no other business, and therefore to restrict them from entering the palace was not apt.</div>
<A NAME="36601"></A><div id="36601"> </div>
<div class="Purport">In this verse it is figuratively stated that the younger brother of desire suddenly appeared in person when the sages were forbidden to see their most beloved Personality of Godhead. The younger brother of desire is anger. If one&rsquo;s desire is not fulfilled, the younger brother, anger, follows. Here we can mark that even great saintly persons like the Kum&#257;ras were also angry, but they were not angry for their personal interests. They were angry because they were forbidden to enter the palace to see the Personality of Godhead. Therefore the theory that in the perfectional stage one should not have anger is not supported in this verse. Anger will continue even in the liberated stage. These four mendicant brothers, the Kum&#257;ras, were considered liberated persons, but still they were angry because they were restricted in their service to the Lord. The difference between the anger of an ordinary person and that of a liberated person is that an ordinary person becomes angry because his sense desires are not being fulfilled, whereas a liberated person like the Kum&#257;ras becomes angry when restricted in the discharge of duties for serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<A NAME="36602"></A><div id="36602"> </div>
<div class="Purport">In the previous verse it has been clearly mentioned that the Kum&#257;ras were liberated persons. <span class="Italic">Vidit&#257;tma-<a href="/d/tattva" class="d">tattva</a></span> means &ldquo;one who understands the truth of self-realization.&rdquo; One who does not understand the truth of self-realization is called ignorant, but one who understands the self, the Superself, their interrelation, and activities in self-realization is called <span class="Italic">vidit&#257;tma-<a href="/d/tattva" class="d">tattva</a>.</span> Although the Kum&#257;ras were already liberated persons, they nevertheless became angry. This point is very important. Becoming liberated does not necessitate losing one&rsquo;s sensual activities. Sense activities continue even in the liberated stage. The difference is, however, that sense activities in liberation are accepted only in connection with <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness, whereas sense activities in the conditioned stage are enacted for personal sense gratification.</div>
