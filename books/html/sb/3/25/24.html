<div class="First"><a href="/d/kapila" class="d">Kapila</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> herein advises His mother, <a href="/d/devahuti" class="d">Devah&#363;ti</a>, that if she wants to be free from material attachment, she should increase her attachment for the <span class="Italic">s&#257;dhus,</span> or devotees who are completely freed from all material attachment. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a>,</span> Fifteenth Chapter, verse 5, it is stated who is qualified to enter into the kingdom of Godhead. It is said there, <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/nirmana" class="d">nirm&#257;na</a>-<a href="/d/moha" class="d">moh&#257;</a> <a href="/d/jita" class="d">jita</a>-<a href="/d/sanga" class="d">sa&#7749;ga</a>-<a href="/d/dosah" class="d">do&#7779;&#257;&#7717;</a>.</span> This refers to one who is completely freed from the puffed-up condition of material possessiveness. A person may be materially very rich, opulent or respectable, but if he at all wants to transfer himself to the spiritual kingdom, back home, back to Godhead, then he has to be freed from the puffed-up condition of material possessiveness, because that is a false position.</div>
<A NAME="42097"></A><div id="42097"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/moha" class="d">moha</a></span> used here means the false understanding that one is rich or poor. In this material world, the conception that one is very rich or very poor&mdash;or any such consciousness in connection with material existence&mdash;is false, because this body itself is false, or temporary. A pure soul who is prepared to be freed from this material entanglement must first of all be free from the association of the three modes of nature. Our consciousness at the present moment is polluted because of association with the three modes of nature; therefore in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> the same principle is stated. It is advised, <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/jita" class="d">jita</a>-<a href="/d/sanga" class="d">sa&#7749;ga</a>-<a href="/d/dosah" class="d">do&#7779;&#257;&#7717;</a>:</span> one should be freed from the contaminated association of the three modes of material nature. Here also, in the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a>,</span> this is confirmed: a pure devotee, who is preparing to transfer himself to the spiritual kingdom, is also freed from the association of the three modes of material nature. We have to seek the association of such devotees. For this reason we have begun the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. There are many mercantile, scientific and other associations in human society to develop a particular type of education or consciousness, but there is no association which helps one to get free from all material association. If anyone has reached the stage where he must become free from this material contamination, then he has to seek the association of devotees, wherein <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness is exclusively cultured. One can thereby become freed from all material association.</div>
<A NAME="42098"></A><div id="42098"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Because a devotee is freed from all contaminated material association, he is not affected by the miseries of material existence. Even though he appears to be in the material world, he is not affected by the miseries of the material world. How is it possible? There is a very good example in the activities of the cat. The cat carries her kittens in her mouth, and when she kills a <a href="/d/rat" class="d">rat</a> she also carries the booty in her mouth. Thus both are carried in the mouth of the cat, but they are in different conditions. The kitten feels comfort in the mouth of the mother, whereas when the <a href="/d/rat" class="d">rat</a> is carried in the mouth of the cat, the <a href="/d/rat" class="d">rat</a> feels the blows of death. Similarly, those who are <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sadhavah" class="d">s&#257;dhava&#7717;</a>,</span> or devotees engaged in <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness in the transcendental service of the Lord, do not feel the contamination of material miseries, whereas those who are not devotees in <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness actually feel the miseries of material existence. One should therefore give up the association of materialistic persons and seek the association of persons engaged in <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness, and by such association he will benefit in spiritual advancement. By their words and instructions, he will be able to cut off his attachment to material existence.</div>
