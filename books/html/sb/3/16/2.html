<div class="Translation">The Personality of Godhead said: These attendants of Mine, <a href="/d/jaya" class="d">Jaya</a> and <a href="/d/vijaya" class="d">Vijaya</a> by name, have committed a great offense against you because of ignoring Me.</div>

<div class="First">To commit an offense at the feet of a devotee of the Lord is a great wrong. Even when a living entity is promoted to <a href="/d/vaikuntha" class="d">Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha</a>, there is still the chance that he may commit offenses, but the difference is that when one is in a <a href="/d/vaikuntha" class="d">Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha</a> planet, even if by chance one commits an offense, he is protected by the Lord. This is the remarkable fact in the dealings of the Lord and the servitor, as seen in the present incident concerning <a href="/d/jaya" class="d">Jaya</a> and <a href="/d/vijaya" class="d">Vijaya</a>. The word <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/atikramam" class="d">atikramam</a></span> used herein indicates that in offending a devotee one neglects the Supreme Lord Himself.</div>
<A NAME="36895"></A><div id="36895"> </div>
<div class="Purport">By mistake the doormen held the sages from entering Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;haloka, but because they were engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord, their annihilation was not expected by advanced devotees. The Lord&rsquo;s presence on the spot was very pleasing to the hearts of the devotees. The Lord understood that the trouble was due to His lotus feet not being seen by the sages, and therefore He wanted to please them by personally going there. The Lord is so merciful that even if there is some impediment for the devotee, He Himself manages matters in such a way that the devotee is not bereft of having audience at His lotus feet. There is a very good example in the life of <a href="/d/haridasa" class="d">Harid&#257;sa</a> &#7788;h&#257;kura. When <a href="/d/caitanya" class="d">Caitanya</a> <a href="/d/mahaprabhu" class="d">Mah&#257;prabhu</a> was residing at <a href="/d/jagannatha" class="d">Jagann&#257;tha</a> <a href="/d/puri" class="d">pur&#299;</a>, <a href="/d/haridasa" class="d">Harid&#257;sa</a> &#7788;h&#257;kura, who happened to be Muhammadan by birth, was with Him. In <a href="/d/hindu" class="d">Hindu</a> temples, especially in those days, no one but a <a href="/d/hindu" class="d">Hindu</a> was allowed to enter. Although <a href="/d/haridasa" class="d">Harid&#257;sa</a> &#7788;h&#257;kura was the greatest of all Hindus in his behavior, he considered himself a Muhammadan and did not enter the temple. Lord <a href="/d/caitanya" class="d">Caitanya</a> could understand his humility, and since he did not go to see the temple, Lord <a href="/d/caitanya" class="d">Caitanya</a> Himself, who is nondifferent from <a href="/d/jagannatha" class="d">Jagann&#257;tha</a>, used to come and sit with <a href="/d/haridasa" class="d">Harid&#257;sa</a> &#7788;h&#257;kura daily. Here in <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a></span> we also find this same behavior of the Lord. His devotees were prevented from seeing His lotus feet, but the Lord Himself came to see them on the same lotus feet for which they aspired. It is also significant that He was accompanied by the goddess of fortune. The goddess of fortune is not to be seen by ordinary persons, but the Lord was so kind that although the devotees did not aspire for such an honor, He appeared before them with the goddess of fortune.</div>
