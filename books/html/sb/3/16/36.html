<div class="Translation">It is the prowess of these twin asuras [demons] that has disturbed you, for it has minimized your power. There is no remedy within my power, however, for it is the Lord Himself who desires to do all this.</div>

<div class="First">Although Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu and <a href="/d/hiranyaksa" class="d">Hira&#7751;y&#257;k&#7779;a</a>, formerly <a href="/d/jaya" class="d">Jaya</a> and <a href="/d/vijaya" class="d">Vijaya</a>, became <span class="Italic">asuras,</span> the demigods of this material world could not control them, and therefore Lord <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> said that neither he nor all the demigods could counteract the disturbance they created. They came within the material world by the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He alone could counteract such disturbances. In other words, although <a href="/d/jaya" class="d">Jaya</a> and <a href="/d/vijaya" class="d">Vijaya</a> assumed the bodies of <span class="Italic">asuras,</span> they remained more powerful than anyone, thus proving that the Supreme Personality of Godhead desired to fight because the fighting spirit is also within Him. He is the original in everything, but when He desires to fight He must fight with a devotee. Therefore by His desire only were <a href="/d/jaya" class="d">Jaya</a> and <a href="/d/vijaya" class="d">Vijaya</a> cursed by the Kum&#257;ras. The Lord ordered the gatekeepers to go down to the material world to become His enemies so that He could fight with them and His fighting desires would be satisfied by the service of His personal devotees.</div>
<A NAME="37340"></A><div id="37340"> </div>
<div class="Purport"><a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> showed the demigods that the situation created by the darkness, for which they were disturbed, was the desire of the Supreme Lord. He wanted to show that even though these two attendants were coming in the forms of demons, they were very powerful, greater than the demigods, who could not control them. No one can surpass the acts of the Supreme Lord. The demigods were also advised not to try to counteract this incident, because it was ordered by the Lord. Similarly, anyone who is ordered by the Lord to perform some action in this material world, especially preaching His glories, cannot be counteracted by anyone; the will of the Lord is executed under all circumstances.</div>
