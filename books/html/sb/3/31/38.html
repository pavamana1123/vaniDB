<div class="First">There are many instances in the history of the world of a great conqueror&rsquo;s being captivated by the charms of a Cleopatra. One has to study the captivating potency of woman, and man&rsquo;s attraction for that potency. From what source was this generated? According to <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/vedanta" class="d">Ved&#257;nta</a>-<a href="/d/sutra" class="d">s&#363;tra</a>,</span> we can understand that everything is generated from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is enunciated there, <span class="Italic">janm&#257;dy <a href="/d/asya" class="d">asya</a> <a href="/d/yatah" class="d">yata&#7717;</a></I> [SB </I><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/1/1/1?d=1">1.1.1</a></I>]</I>.</span> This means that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or the Supreme Person, <a href="/d/brahman" class="d">Brahman</a>, the Absolute Truth, is the source from whom everything emanates. The captivating power of woman, and man&rsquo;s susceptibility to such attraction, must also exist in the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the spiritual world and must be represented in the transcendental pastimes of the Lord.</div>
<A NAME="45919"></A><div id="45919"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The Lord is the Supreme Person, the supreme male. As a common male wants to be attracted by a female, that propensity similarly exists in the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He also wants to be attracted by the beautiful features of a woman. Now the question is, if He wants to be captivated by such womanly attraction, would He be attracted by any material woman? It is not possible. Even persons who are in this material existence can give up womanly attraction if they are attracted by the Supreme <a href="/d/brahman" class="d">Brahman</a>. Such was the case with <a href="/d/haridasa" class="d">Harid&#257;sa</a> &#7788;h&#257;kura. A beautiful prostitute tried to attract him in the dead of night, but since he was situated in devotional service, in transcendental love of Godhead, <a href="/d/haridasa" class="d">Harid&#257;sa</a> &#7788;h&#257;kura was not captivated. Rather, he turned the prostitute into a great devotee by his transcendental association. This material attraction, therefore, certainly cannot attract the Supreme Lord. When He wants to be attracted by a woman, He has to create such a woman from His own energy. That woman is R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;&#7751;&#299;. It is explained by the Gosv&#257;m&#299;s that R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;&#7751;&#299; is the manifestation of the pleasure potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When the Supreme Lord wants to derive transcendental pleasure, He has to create a woman from His internal potency. Thus the tendency to be attracted by womanly beauty is natural because it exists in the spiritual world. In the material world it is reflected pervertedly, and therefore there are so many inebrieties.</div>
<A NAME="45920"></A><div id="45920"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Instead of being attracted by material beauty, if one is accustomed to be attracted by the beauty of R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;&#7751;&#299; and <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, then the statement of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a>,</span> <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/param" class="d">para&#7745;</a> <a href="/d/drstva" class="d">d&#7771;&#7779;&#7789;v&#257;</a> <a href="/d/nivartate" class="d">nivartate</a>,</span> holds true. When one is attracted by the transcendental beauty of <a href="/d/radha" class="d">R&#257;dh&#257;</a> and <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, he is no longer attracted by material feminine beauty. That is the special significance of <a href="/d/radha" class="d">R&#257;dh&#257;</a>-<a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> worship. That is testified to by Y&#257;mun&#257;c&#257;rya. He says, &ldquo;Since I have become attracted by the beauty of <a href="/d/radha" class="d">R&#257;dh&#257;</a> and <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, when there is attraction for a woman or a memory of sex life with a woman, I at once spit on it, and my face turns in disgust.&rdquo; When we are attracted by <a href="/d/madana" class="d">Madana</a>-<a href="/d/mohana" class="d">mohana</a> and the beauty of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> and His consorts, then the shackles of conditioned life, namely the beauty of a material woman, cannot attract us.</div>
