<div class="Translation">If, therefore, the living entity again associates with the path of unrighteousness, influenced by sensually minded people engaged in the pursuit of sexual enjoyment and the gratification of the palate, he again goes to hell as before.</div>

<div class="First">It has been explained that the conditioned soul is put into the <a href="/d/andha" class="d">Andha</a>-<a href="/d/tamisra" class="d">t&#257;misra</a> and <a href="/d/tamisra" class="d">T&#257;misra</a> hellish conditions, and after suffering there he gets a hellish body like the dog&rsquo;s or hog&rsquo;s. After several such births, he again comes into the form of a human being. How the human being is born is also described by Kapiladeva. The human being develops in the mother&rsquo;s abdomen and suffers there and comes out again. After all these sufferings, if he gets another chance in a human body and wastes his valuable time in the association of persons who are concerned with sexual life and palatable dishes, then naturally he again glides down to the same <a href="/d/andha" class="d">Andha</a>-<a href="/d/tamisra" class="d">t&#257;misra</a> and <a href="/d/tamisra" class="d">T&#257;misra</a> hells.</div>
<A NAME="45839"></A><div id="45839"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Generally, people are concerned with the satisfaction of the tongue and the satisfaction of the genitals. That is material life. Material life means eat, drink, be merry and enjoy, with no concern for understanding one&rsquo;s spiritual identity and the process of spiritual advancement. Since materialistic people are concerned with the tongue, belly and genitals, if anyone wants to advance in spiritual life he must be very careful about associating with such people. To associate with such materialistic men is to commit purposeful suicide in the human form of life. It is said, therefore, that an intelligent man should give up such undesirable association and should always mix with saintly persons. When he is in association with saintly persons, all his doubts about the spiritual expansion of life are eradicated, and he makes tangible progress on the path of spiritual understanding. It is also sometimes found that people are very much addicted to a particular type of religious faith. Hindus, Muslims and Christians are faithful in their particular type of religion, and they go to the church, temple or mosque, but unfortunately they cannot give up the association of persons who are too much addicted to sex life and satisfaction of the palate. Here it is clearly said that one may officially be a very religious man, but if he associates with such persons, then he is sure to slide down to the darkest region of hell.</div>
