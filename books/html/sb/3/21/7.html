<div class="Translation">During that period of penance, the sage <a href="/d/kardama" class="d">Kardama</a>, by worship through devotional service in trance, propitiated the Personality of Godhead, who is the quick bestower of all blessings upon those who flee to Him for protection.</div>

<div class="First">The significance of meditation is described here. <a href="/d/kardama" class="d">Kardama</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> practiced mystic <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> meditation for ten thousand years just to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead, <a href="/d/hari" class="d">Hari</a>. Therefore, whether one practices <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> or speculates and does research to find God, one&rsquo;s efforts must be mixed with the process of devotion. Without devotion, nothing can be perfect. The target of perfection and realization is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the Sixth Chapter of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> it is clearly said that one who constantly engages in <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness is the topmost <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yogi" class="d">yog&#299;</a>.</span> The Personality of Godhead, <a href="/d/hari" class="d">Hari</a>, also fulfills the desires of His surrendered devotee. One has to surrender unto the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead, <a href="/d/hari" class="d">Hari</a>, or <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, in order to achieve real success. Devotional service, or engagement in <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness, is the direct method, and all other methods, although recommended, are indirect. In this age of <a href="/d/kali" class="d">Kali</a> the direct method is especially more feasible than the indirect because people are short-living, their intelligence is poor, and they are poverty-stricken and embarrassed by so many miserable disturbances. Lord <a href="/d/caitanya" class="d">Caitanya</a>, therefore, has given the greatest boon: in this age one simply has to chant the holy name of God to attain perfection in spiritual life.</div>
<A NAME="39338"></A><div id="39338"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The words <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/samprapede" class="d">samprapede</a> <a href="/d/harim" class="d">harim</a></span> mean that in various ways <a href="/d/kardama" class="d">Kardama</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> satisfied the Supreme Personality of Godhead, <a href="/d/hari" class="d">Hari</a>, by his devotional service. Devotional service is also expressed by the word <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/kriya" class="d">kriy&#257;</a>-<a href="/d/yogena" class="d">yogena</a>.</span> <a href="/d/kardama" class="d">Kardama</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> not only meditated but also engaged in devotional service; to attain perfection in <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> practice or meditation, one must act in devotional service by hearing, chanting, remembering, etc. Remembering is meditation also. But who is to be remembered? One should remember the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Not only must one remember the Supreme Person; one must hear about the activities of the Lord and chant His glories. This information is in the authoritative scriptures. After engaging himself for ten thousand years in performing different types of devotional service, <a href="/d/kardama" class="d">Kardama</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> attained the perfection of meditation, but that is not possible in this age of <a href="/d/kali" class="d">Kali</a>, wherein it is very difficult to live for as much as one hundred years. At the present moment, who will be successful in the rigid performance of the many <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> rules and regulations? Moreover, perfection is attained only by those who are surrendered souls. Where there is no mention of the Personality of Godhead, where is there surrender? And where there is no meditation upon the Personality of Godhead, where is the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> practice? Unfortunately, people in this age, especially persons who are of a demoniac nature, want to be cheated. Thus the Supreme Personality of Godhead sends great cheaters who mislead them in the name of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> and render their lives useless and doomed. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a>,</span> therefore, it is clearly stated, in the Sixteenth Chapter, verse 17, that rascals of self-made authority, being puffed up by illegally collected money, perform <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> without following the authoritative books. They are very proud of the money they have plundered from innocent persons who wanted to be cheated.</div>
