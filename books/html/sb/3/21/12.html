<div class="First">The realization of the personal form of the Lord is the highest perfectional stage of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a>.</span> In the Sixth Chapter of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a>,</span> where <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> practice is described, this realization of the personal form of the Lord is called the perfection of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a>.</span> After practicing the sitting postures and other regulative principles of the system, one finally reaches the stage of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/samadhi" class="d">sam&#257;dhi</a></span>&mdash;absorption in the Supreme. In the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/samadhi" class="d">sam&#257;dhi</a></span> stage one can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His partial form as <a href="/d/paramatma" class="d">Param&#257;tm&#257;</a>, or as He is. <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/samadhi" class="d">Sam&#257;dhi</a></span> is described in authoritative <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> scriptures, such as the <span class="Italic">Pata&ntilde;jali-s&#363;tras,</span> to be a transcendental pleasure. The <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> system described in the books of Pata&ntilde;jali is authoritative, and the modern so-called <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> who have manufactured their own ways, not consulting the authorities, are simply ludicrous. The Pata&ntilde;jali <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> system is called <span class="Italic">a&#7779;&#7789;&#257;&#7749;ga-<a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a>.</span> Sometimes impersonalists pollute the Pata&ntilde;jali <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> system because they are monists. Pata&ntilde;jali describes that the soul is transcendentally pleased when he meets the Supersoul and sees Him. If the existence of the Supersoul and the individual is admitted, then the impersonalist theory of monism is nullified. Therefore some impersonalists and void philosophers twist the Pata&ntilde;jali system in their own way and pollute the whole <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> process.</div>
<A NAME="39400"></A><div id="39400"> </div>
<div class="Purport">According to Pata&ntilde;jali, when one becomes free from all material desires he attains his real, transcendental situation, and realization of that stage is called spiritual power. In material activities a person engages in the modes of material nature. The aspirations of such people are (1) to be religious, (2) to be economically enriched, (3) to be able to gratify the senses and, at last, (4) to become one with the Supreme. According to the monists, when a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yogi" class="d">yog&#299;</a></span> becomes one with the Supreme and loses his individual existence, he attains the highest stage, called <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/kaivalya" class="d">kaivalya</a>.</span> But actually, the stage of realization of the Personality of Godhead is <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/kaivalya" class="d">kaivalya</a>.</span> The oneness of understanding that the Supreme Lord is fully spiritual and that in full spiritual realization one can understand what He is&mdash;the Supreme Personality of Godhead&mdash;is called <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/kaivalya" class="d">kaivalya</a>,</span> or, in the language of Pata&ntilde;jali, realization of spiritual power. His proposal is that when one is freed from material desires and fixed in spiritual realization of the self and the Superself, that is called <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/cit" class="d">cit</a>-<a href="/d/sakti" class="d">&#347;akti</a>.</span> In full spiritual realization there is a perception of spiritual happiness, and that happiness is described in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> as the supreme happiness, which is beyond the material senses. Trance is described to be of two kinds, <span class="Italic">sampraj&ntilde;&#257;ta</span> and <span class="Italic">asampraj&ntilde;&#257;ta,</span> or mental speculation and self-realization. In <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/samadhi" class="d">sam&#257;dhi</a></span> or <span class="Italic">asampraj&ntilde;&#257;ta</span> one can realize, by his spiritual senses, the spiritual form of the Lord. That is the ultimate goal of spiritual realization.</div>
<A NAME="39401"></A><div id="39401"> </div>
<div class="Purport">According to Pata&ntilde;jali, when one is fixed in constant realization of the supreme form of the Lord, one has attained the perfectional stage, as attained by <a href="/d/kardama" class="d">Kardama</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a>. Unless one attains this stage of perfection&mdash;beyond the perfection of the preliminaries of the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> system&mdash;there is no ultimate realization. There are eight perfections in the <span class="Italic">a&#7779;&#7789;&#257;&#7749;ga-<a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> system. One who has attained them can become lighter than the lightest and greater than the greatest, and he can achieve whatever he likes. But even achieving such material success in <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> is not the perfection or the ultimate goal. The ultimate goal is described here: <a href="/d/kardama" class="d">Kardama</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> saw the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His eternal form. Devotional service begins with the relationship of the individual soul and the Supreme Soul, or <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> and K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s devotees, and when one attains it there is no question of falling down. If, through the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> system, one wants to attain the stage of seeing the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face, but is attracted instead to attainment of some material power, then he is detoured from proceeding further. Material enjoyment, as encouraged by bogus <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s,</span> has nothing to do with the transcendental realization of spiritual happiness. Real devotees of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">bhakti</a>-<a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> accept only the material necessities of life absolutely needed to maintain the body and soul together; they refrain completely from all exaggerated material sense gratification. They are prepared to undergo all kinds of tribulation, provided they can make progress in the realization of the Personality of Godhead.</div>
