<div class="First">The nine principal <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;is,</span> or sages, are <a href="/d/marici" class="d">Mar&#299;ci</a>, <a href="/d/atri" class="d">Atri</a>, A&#7749;gir&#257;, <a href="/d/pulastya" class="d">Pulastya</a>, <a href="/d/pulaha" class="d">Pulaha</a>, <a href="/d/kratu" class="d">Kratu</a>, <a href="/d/bhrgu" class="d">Bh&#7771;gu</a>, <a href="/d/vasistha" class="d">Vasi&#7779;&#7789;ha</a> and <a href="/d/atharva" class="d">Atharv&#257;</a>. All these <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;is</span> are most important, and <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> desired that the nine daughters already born of <a href="/d/kardama" class="d">Kardama</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> be handed over to them. Here two words are used very significantly&mdash;<span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yatha" class="d">yath&#257;</a>-<a href="/d/silam" class="d">&#347;&#299;lam</a></span> and <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yatha" class="d">yath&#257;</a>-<a href="/d/ruci" class="d">ruci</a>.</span> The daughters should be handed over to the respective <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;is,</span> not blindly, but according to the combination of character and taste. That is the art of combining a man and woman. Man and woman should not be united simply on the consideration of sex life. There are many other considerations, especially character and taste. If the taste and character differ between the man and woman, their combination will be unhappy. Even about forty years ago, in Indian marriages, the taste and character of the boy and girl were first of all matched, and then they were allowed to marry. This was done under the direction of the respective parents. The parents used to astrologically determine the character and tastes of the boy and girl, and when they corresponded, the match was selected: &ldquo;This girl and this boy are just suitable, and they should be married.&rdquo; Other considerations were less important. The same system was also advised in the beginning of the creation by <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a>: &ldquo;Your daughters should be handed over to the <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;is</span> according to taste and character.&rdquo;</div>
<A NAME="41348"></A><div id="41348"> </div>
<div class="Purport">According to astrological calculation, a person is classified according to whether he belongs to the godly or demoniac quality. In that way the spouse was selected. A girl of godly quality should be handed over to a boy of godly quality. A girl of demoniac quality should be handed over to a boy of demoniac quality. Then they will be happy. But if the girl is demoniac and the boy is godly, then the combination is incompatible; they cannot be happy in such a marriage. At the present moment, because boys and girls are not married according to quality and character, most marriages are unhappy, and there is divorce.</div>
<A NAME="41349"></A><div id="41349"> </div>
<div class="Purport">It is foretold in the Twelfth Canto of the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a></span> that in this age of <a href="/d/kali" class="d">Kali</a> married life will be accepted on the consideration of sex only; when the boy and girl are pleased in sex, they get married, and when there is deficiency in sex, they separate. That is not actual marriage, but a combination of men and women like cats and dogs. Therefore, the children produced in the modern age are not exactly human beings. Human beings must be twice-born. A child is first born of a good father and mother, and then he is born again of the spiritual master and the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> The first mother and father bring about his birth into the world; then the spiritual master and the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> become his second father and mother. According to the Vedic system of marriage for producing children, every man and woman was enlightened in spiritual knowledge, and at the time of their combination to produce a child, everything was scrutinizingly and scientifically done.</div>
