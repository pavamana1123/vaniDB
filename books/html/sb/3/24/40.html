<div class="First"><a href="/d/kardama" class="d">Kardama</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> was anxious about his good wife, <a href="/d/devahuti" class="d">Devah&#363;ti</a>, while leaving home, and so the worthy son promised that not only would <a href="/d/kardama" class="d">Kardama</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> be freed from the material entanglement, but <a href="/d/devahuti" class="d">Devah&#363;ti</a> would also be freed by receiving instruction from her son. A very good example is set here: the husband goes away, taking the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sannyasa" class="d">sanny&#257;sa</a></span> order for self-realization, but his representative, the son, who is equally educated, remains at home to deliver the mother. A <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sannyasi" class="d">sanny&#257;s&#299;</a></span> is not supposed to take his wife with him. At the <span class="Italic">v&#257;naprastha</span> stage of retired life, or the stage midway between householder life and renounced life, one may keep his wife as an assistant without sex relations, but in the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sannyasa" class="d">sanny&#257;sa</a></span> order of life one cannot keep his wife with him. Otherwise, a person like <a href="/d/kardama" class="d">Kardama</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> could have kept his wife with him, and there would have been no hindrance to his prosecution of self-realization.</div>
<A NAME="41670"></A><div id="41670"> </div>
<div class="Purport"><a href="/d/kardama" class="d">Kardama</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> followed the Vedic injunction that no one in <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sannyasa" class="d">sanny&#257;sa</a></span> life can have any kind of relationship with women. But what is the position of a woman who is left by her husband? She is entrusted to the son, and the son promises that he will deliver his mother from entanglement. A woman is not supposed to take <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sannyasa" class="d">sanny&#257;sa</a>.</span> So-called spiritual societies concocted in modern times give <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sannyasa" class="d">sanny&#257;sa</a></span> even to women, although there is no sanction in the Vedic literature for a woman&rsquo;s accepting <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sannyasa" class="d">sanny&#257;sa</a>.</span> Otherwise, if it were sanctioned, <a href="/d/kardama" class="d">Kardama</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> could have taken his wife and given her <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sannyasa" class="d">sanny&#257;sa</a>.</span> The woman must remain at home. She has only three stages of life: dependency on the father in childhood, dependency on the husband in youth and, in old age, dependency on the grown-up son, such as <a href="/d/kapila" class="d">Kapila</a>. In old age the progress of woman depends on the grown-up son. The ideal son, <a href="/d/kapila" class="d">Kapila</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a>, is assuring His father of the deliverance of His mother so that His father may go peacefully without anxiety for his good wife.</div>
