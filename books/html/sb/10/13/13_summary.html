<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">This chapter describes Lord Brahm&#257;&rsquo;s attempt to take away the calves and cowherd boys, and it also describes the bewilderment of Lord <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> and finally the clearance of his illusion.</div>
</div><A NAME="127803"></A><div id="127803"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Although the incident concerning <a href="/d/aghasura" class="d">Agh&#257;sura</a> had been performed one year before, when the cowherd boys were five years old, when they were six years old they said, &ldquo;It happened today.&rdquo; What happened was this. After killing <a href="/d/aghasura" class="d">Agh&#257;sura</a>, <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, along with His associates the cowherd boys, went for a picnic within the forest. The calves, being allured by green grasses, gradually went far away, and therefore K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s associates became a little agitated and wanted to bring back the calves. <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, however, encouraged the boys by saying, &ldquo;You take your <span class="Italic">tiffin</span> without being agitated. I shall go find the calves.&rdquo; And thus the Lord departed. Then, just to examine the potency of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, Lord <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> took away all the calves and cowherd boys and kept them in a secluded place.</div>
</div><A NAME="127804"></A><div id="127804"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">When <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> was unable to find the calves and boys, He could understand that this was a trick performed by <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a>. Then the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes, in order to please Lord <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a>, as well as His own associates and their mothers, expanded Himself to become the calves and boys, exactly as they were before. In this way, He discovered another pastime. A special feature of this pastime was that the mothers of the cowherd boys thus became more attached to their respective sons, and the cows became more attached to their calves. After nearly a year, <a href="/d/baladeva" class="d">Baladeva</a> observed that all the cowherd boys and calves were expansions of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. Thus He inquired from <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> and was informed of what had happened.</div>
</div><A NAME="127805"></A><div id="127805"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">When one full year had passed, <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> returned and saw that <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> was still engaged as usual with His friends and the calves and cows. Then <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> exhibited all the calves and cowherd boys as four-armed forms of <a href="/d/narayana" class="d">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</a>. <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> could then understand K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s potency, and he was astonished by the pastimes of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, his worshipable Lord. <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, however, bestowed His causeless mercy upon <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> and released him from illusion. Thus <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> began to offer prayers to glorify the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
