<div class="Translation">Because of an increase of affection, the cows had constant attachment even to those calves that were grown up and had stopped sucking milk from their mothers. When <a href="/d/baladeva" class="d">Baladeva</a> saw this attachment, He was unable to understand the reason for it, and thus He began to consider as follows.</div>

<div class="First">The cows had younger calves who had started sucking milk from their mothers, and some of the cows had newly given birth, but now, because of love, the cows enthusiastically showed their affection for the older calves, which had left off milking. These calves were grown up, but still the mothers wanted to feed them. Therefore <a href="/d/balarama" class="d">Balar&#257;ma</a> was a little surprised, and He wanted to inquire from <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> about the reason for their behavior. The mothers were actually more anxious to feed the older calves, although the new calves were present, because the older calves were expansions of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. These surprising events were taking place by the manipulation of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yogamaya" class="d">yogam&#257;y&#257;</a>.</span> There are two <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;s</span> working under the direction of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>&mdash;<span class="Italic">mah&#257;m&#257;y&#257;,</span> the energy of the material world, and <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yogamaya" class="d">yogam&#257;y&#257;</a>,</span> the energy of the spiritual world. These uncommon events were taking place because of the influence of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yogamaya" class="d">yogam&#257;y&#257;</a>.</span> From the very day on which <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> stole the calves and boys, <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yogamaya" class="d">yogam&#257;y&#257;</a></span> acted in such a way that the residents of <a href="/d/vrndavana" class="d">V&#7771;nd&#257;vana</a>, including even Lord <a href="/d/balarama" class="d">Balar&#257;ma</a>, could not understand how <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yogamaya" class="d">yogam&#257;y&#257;</a></span> was working and causing such uncommon things to happen. But as <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yogamaya" class="d">yogam&#257;y&#257;</a></span> gradually acted, <a href="/d/balarama" class="d">Balar&#257;ma</a> in particular was able to understand what was happening, and therefore He inquired from <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>.</div>
