<div class="Translation">When Lord <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> returned after a moment of time had passed (according to his own measurement), he saw that although by human measurement a complete year had passed, Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, after all that time, was engaged just as before in playing with the boys and calves, who were His expansions.</div>

<div class="First">Lord <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> had gone away for only a moment of his time, but when he returned, a year of human time had passed. On different planets, the calculation of time is different. To give an example, a man-made satellite may orbit the earth in an hour and twenty-five minutes and thus complete one full day, although a day ordinarily takes twenty-four hours for those living on earth. Therefore, what was but a moment for <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> was one year on earth. <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> continued to expand Himself in so many forms for one year, but by the arrangement of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yogamaya" class="d">yogam&#257;y&#257;</a></span> no one could understand this but <a href="/d/balarama" class="d">Balar&#257;ma</a>.</div>
<A NAME="128322"></A><div id="128322"> </div>
<div class="Purport">After one moment of Brahm&#257;&rsquo;s calculation, <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> came back to see the fun caused by his stealing the boys and calves. But he was also afraid that he was playing with fire. <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> was his master, and he had played mischief for fun by taking away K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s calves and boys. He was really anxious, so he did not stay away very long; he came back after a moment (of his calculation). When <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> returned, he saw that all the boys, calves and cows were playing with <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> in the same way as when he had come upon them; by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s display of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yogamaya" class="d">yogam&#257;y&#257;</a>,</span> the same pastimes were going on without any change.</div>
<A NAME="128323"></A><div id="128323"> </div>
<div class="Purport">On the day when Lord <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> had first come, <a href="/d/baladeva" class="d">Baladeva</a> could not go with <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> and the cowherd boys, for it was His birthday, and His mother had kept Him back for the proper ceremonial bath, called <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;ntika-<a href="/d/snana" class="d">sn&#257;na</a>.</span> Therefore Lord <a href="/d/baladeva" class="d">Baladeva</a> was not taken by <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> at that time. Now, one year later, <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> returned, and because he returned on exactly the same day, <a href="/d/baladeva" class="d">Baladeva</a> was again kept at home for His birthday. Therefore, although this verse mentions that <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> saw <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> and all the cowherd boys, <a href="/d/baladeva" class="d">Baladeva</a> is not mentioned. It was five or six days earlier that <a href="/d/baladeva" class="d">Baladeva</a> had inquired from <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> about the extraordinary affection of the cows and cowherd men, but now, when <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> returned, <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> saw all the calves and cowherd boys playing with <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> as expansions of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, but he did not see <a href="/d/baladeva" class="d">Baladeva</a>. As in the previous year, Lord <a href="/d/baladeva" class="d">Baladeva</a> did not go to the woods on the day Lord <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> appeared there.</div>
