<div class="First">The cowherd men were very much agitated because the child <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, after all, had been standing between the two trees, and if by chance the trees had fallen upon Him, He would have been smashed. But He was standing as He was, and still the things had happened, so who had done all this? How could these events have happened in such a wonderful way? These considerations were some of the reasons they were agitated and bewildered. They thought, however, that by chance <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> had been saved by God so that nothing had happened to Him.</div>
