<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">This chapter describes how the inhabitants of <a href="/d/gokula" class="d">Gokula</a> left <a href="/d/gokula" class="d">Gokula</a> and went to <a href="/d/vrndavana" class="d">V&#7771;nd&#257;vana</a> and how <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> killed Vats&#257;sura and Bak&#257;sura.</div>
</div><A NAME="126559"></A><div id="126559"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">When the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yamala" class="d">yamala</a>-<a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">arjuna</a></span> trees fell, they made a tremendous sound, like that of falling thunderbolts. Being surprised, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s father, <a href="/d/nanda" class="d">Nanda</a>, and the other elderly inhabitants of <a href="/d/gokula" class="d">Gokula</a> went to the spot, where they saw the fallen trees and <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> standing between them, bound to the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/ulukhala" class="d">ul&#363;khala</a>,</span> the wooden mortar. They could find no cause for the trees&rsquo; having fallen and K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s being there. They thought this might be the work of some other <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/asura" class="d">asura</a></span> who had met <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> on this spot, and they inquired from the playmates of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> about how the whole incident had taken place. The children properly described how everything had happened, but the elderly persons could not believe the story. Some of them, however, thought that it might be true, since they had already seen many wonderful incidents in connection with <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. Anyway, <a href="/d/nanda" class="d">Nanda</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> immediately released <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> from the ropes.</div>
</div><A NAME="126560"></A><div id="126560"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">In this way, <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, at every day and every moment, displayed wonderful incidents to increase the parental affection of <a href="/d/nanda" class="d">Nanda</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> and <a href="/d/yasoda" class="d">Ya&#347;od&#257;</a>, who thus felt both surprise and joy. The breaking of the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yamala" class="d">yamala</a>-arjunas</span> was one of these wonderful pastimes.</div>
</div><A NAME="126561"></A><div id="126561"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">One day a fruit vendor approached <a href="/d/nanda" class="d">Nanda</a> Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s house, and <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> gathered some food grains with His little palms and went to the vendor to exchange the grains for fruit. On the way, almost all the grains fell from His palms, only one or two grains remaining, but the fruit vendor, out of full affection, accepted these grains in exchange for as much fruit as <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> could take. As soon as she did this, her basket became filled with gold and jewels.</div>
</div><A NAME="126562"></A><div id="126562"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Thereafter, all the elderly <span class="Italic">gopas</span> decided to leave <a href="/d/gokula" class="d">Gokula</a> because they saw that in <a href="/d/gokula" class="d">Gokula</a> there was always some disturbance. They decided to go to <a href="/d/vrndavana" class="d">V&#7771;nd&#257;vana</a>, <a href="/d/vraja" class="d">Vraja</a>-<a href="/d/dhama" class="d">dh&#257;ma</a>, and the next day they all departed. In <a href="/d/vrndavana" class="d">V&#7771;nd&#257;vana</a>, both <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> and <a href="/d/balarama" class="d">Balar&#257;ma</a>, after finishing Their childhood pastimes, began to take charge of the calves and send them to the pasturing grounds (<span class="Italic">go-<a href="/d/carana" class="d">cara&#7751;a</a></span>). During this time, a demon named Vats&#257;sura entered among the calves and was killed, and another <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/asura" class="d">asura</a>,</span> in the shape of a big duck, was also killed. The playmates of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> narrated all these stories to their mothers. The mothers could not believe their children, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s playmates, but because of full affection they enjoyed these narrations of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s activities.</div>
