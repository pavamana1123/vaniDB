<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">As described in this chapter, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, <a href="/d/hari" class="d">Hari</a> in His original form, appeared as <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a> so that His father and mother could understand that their son was the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because they were afraid of <a href="/d/kamsa" class="d">Ka&#7745;sa</a>, when the Lord appeared as an ordinary child they took Him to <a href="/d/gokula" class="d">Gokula</a>, the home of <a href="/d/nanda" class="d">Nanda</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a>.</div>
</div><A NAME="122358"></A><div id="122358"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Mother <a href="/d/devaki" class="d">Devak&#299;</a>, being fully transcendental, <span class="Italic">sac-cid-<a href="/d/ananda" class="d">&#257;nanda</a>,</span> does not belong to this material world. Thus the Supreme Personality of Godhead appeared with four hands, as if born from her womb. Upon seeing the Lord in that <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a> form, <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">Vasudeva</a> was struck with wonder, and in transcendental happiness he and <a href="/d/devaki" class="d">Devak&#299;</a> mentally gave ten thousand cows in charity to the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as.</span> <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">Vasudeva</a> then offered prayers to the Lord, addressing Him as the Supreme Person, Parabrahman, the Supersoul, who is beyond duality and who is internally and externally all-pervading. The Lord, the cause of all causes, is beyond material existence, although He is the creator of this material world. When He enters this world as <a href="/d/paramatma" class="d">Param&#257;tm&#257;</a>, He is all-pervading (<span class="Italic">a&#7751;&#7693;&#257;ntara-<a href="/d/stha" class="d">stha</a>-<a href="/d/paramanu" class="d">param&#257;&#7751;u</a>-cay&#257;ntara-<a href="/d/stham" class="d">stham</a></span>), yet He is transcendentally situated. For the creation, maintenance and annihilation of this material world, the Lord appears as the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/guna" class="d">gu&#7751;a</a>-avat&#257;ras</span>&mdash;<a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a>, <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a> and <a href="/d/mahesvara" class="d">Mahe&#347;vara</a>. Thus <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">Vasudeva</a> offered prayers full of meaning to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. <a href="/d/devaki" class="d">Devak&#299;</a> followed her husband by offering prayers describing the transcendental nature of the Lord. Fearing <a href="/d/kamsa" class="d">Ka&#7745;sa</a> and desiring that the Lord not be understood by atheistic and materialistic nondevotees, she prayed that the Lord withdraw His transcendental four-armed form and appear like an ordinary child with two hands.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">The Lord reminded <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">Vasudeva</a> and <a href="/d/devaki" class="d">Devak&#299;</a> of two other incarnations in which He had appeared as their son. He had appeared as P&#7771;&#347;nigarbha and V&#257;manadeva, and now this was the third time He was appearing as the son of <a href="/d/devaki" class="d">Devak&#299;</a> to fulfill their desire. The Lord then decided to leave the residence of <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">Vasudeva</a> and <a href="/d/devaki" class="d">Devak&#299;</a>, in the prison house of <a href="/d/kamsa" class="d">Ka&#7745;sa</a>, and at this very time, <a href="/d/yogamaya" class="d">Yogam&#257;y&#257;</a> took birth as the daughter of <a href="/d/yasoda" class="d">Ya&#347;od&#257;</a>. By the arrangement of <a href="/d/yogamaya" class="d">Yogam&#257;y&#257;</a>, <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">Vasudeva</a> was able to leave the prison house and save the child from the hands of <a href="/d/kamsa" class="d">Ka&#7745;sa</a>. When <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">Vasudeva</a> brought <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> to the house of <a href="/d/nanda" class="d">Nanda</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a>, he saw that by Yogam&#257;y&#257;&rsquo;s arrangement, <a href="/d/yasoda" class="d">Ya&#347;od&#257;</a>, as well as everyone else, was deeply asleep. Thus he exchanged the babies, taking <a href="/d/yogamaya" class="d">Yogam&#257;y&#257;</a> from Ya&#347;od&#257;&rsquo;s lap and placing <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> there instead. Then <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">Vasudeva</a> returned to his own place, having taken <a href="/d/yogamaya" class="d">Yogam&#257;y&#257;</a> as his daughter. He placed <a href="/d/yogamaya" class="d">Yogam&#257;y&#257;</a> on Devak&#299;&rsquo;s bed and prepared to be a prisoner as before. In <a href="/d/gokula" class="d">Gokula</a>, <a href="/d/yasoda" class="d">Ya&#347;od&#257;</a> could not understand whether she had given birth to a male or a female child.</div>
