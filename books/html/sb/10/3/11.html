<div class="Translation">When <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">Vasudeva</a> saw his extraordinary son, his eyes were struck with wonder. In transcendental jubilation, he mentally collected ten thousand cows and distributed them among the br&#257;hma&#7751;as as a transcendental festival.</div>

<div class="First">&#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha <a href="/d/cakravarti" class="d">Cakravart&#299;</a> &#7788;h&#257;kura has analyzed the wonder of <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">Vasudeva</a> upon seeing his extraordinary child. <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">Vasudeva</a> was shivering with wonder to see a newborn child decorated so nicely with valuable garments and gems. He could immediately understand that the Supreme Personality of Godhead had appeared, not as an ordinary child but in His original, fully decorated, four-handed form. The first wonder was that the Lord was not afraid to appear within the prison house of <a href="/d/kamsa" class="d">Ka&#7745;sa</a>, where <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">Vasudeva</a> and <a href="/d/devaki" class="d">Devak&#299;</a> were interned. Second, although the Lord, the Supreme Transcendence, is all-pervading, He had appeared from the womb of <a href="/d/devaki" class="d">Devak&#299;</a>. The third point of wonder, therefore, was that a child could take birth from the womb so nicely decorated. Fourth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead was Vasudeva&rsquo;s worshipable Deity yet had taken birth as his son. For all these reasons, <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">Vasudeva</a> was transcendentally jubilant, and he wanted to perform a festival, as <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas</span> do to celebrate the birth of a child, but because of his imprisonment he was unable to do it externally, and therefore he performed the festival within his mind. This was just as good. If one cannot externally serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one can serve the Lord within one&rsquo;s mind, since the activities of the mind are as good as those of the other senses. This is called the nondual or absolute situation (<span class="Italic"><a href="/d/advaya" class="d">advaya</a> <a href="/d/jnana" class="d">j&ntilde;&#257;na</a></span>). People generally perform ritualistic ceremonies for the birth of a child. Why then should <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">Vasudeva</a> not have performed such a ceremony when the Supreme Lord appeared as his son?</div>
