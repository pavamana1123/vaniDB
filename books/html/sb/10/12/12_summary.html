<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">This chapter describes in detail K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s pastime of killing <a href="/d/aghasura" class="d">Agh&#257;sura</a>.</div>
</div><A NAME="127286"></A><div id="127286"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">One day <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> wanted to enjoy a picnic lunch within the forest, and therefore He went out early into the forest with the other cowherd boys, accompanied by their respective groups of calves. While they were enjoying their picnic, <a href="/d/aghasura" class="d">Agh&#257;sura</a>, the younger brother of <a href="/d/putana" class="d">P&#363;tan&#257;</a> and Bak&#257;sura, appeared there, desiring to kill <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> and His companions. The demon, who had been sent by <a href="/d/kamsa" class="d">Ka&#7745;sa</a>, assumed the form of a python, expanding himself to a length of eight miles and the height of a mountain, his mouth seeming to extend from the surface of the earth to the heavenly planets. Having assumed this feature, <a href="/d/aghasura" class="d">Agh&#257;sura</a> lay on the road. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s friends, the cowherd boys, thought that the demon&rsquo;s form was one of the beautiful spots of <a href="/d/vrndavana" class="d">V&#7771;nd&#257;vana</a>. Thus they wanted to enter within the mouth of this gigantic python. The gigantic figure of the python became a subject for their sporting pleasure, and they began to laugh, confident that even if this figure were dangerous, <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> was there to protect them. In this way, they proceeded toward the mouth of the gigantic figure.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level"><a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> knew everything about <a href="/d/aghasura" class="d">Agh&#257;sura</a>, and therefore He wanted to forbid His friends to enter the demon&rsquo;s mouth, but in the meantime all the cowherd boys, along with their groups of calves, entered the mouth of that gigantic figure. <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> was waiting outside, and <a href="/d/aghasura" class="d">Agh&#257;sura</a> was waiting for <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, thinking that as soon as <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> entered he would close his mouth so that everyone would die. While waiting for <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, he refrained from swallowing the boys. In the meantime, <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> was thinking of how to save the boys and kill <a href="/d/aghasura" class="d">Agh&#257;sura</a>. Thus He entered the mouth of the gigantic <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/asura" class="d">asura</a>,</span> and when He was within the demon&rsquo;s mouth along with His friends, He expanded His body to such an extent that the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/asura" class="d">asura</a></span> suffocated and died. After this, <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, by casting His nectarean glance upon His friends, brought them back to life, and with pleasure they all came out unhurt. Thus <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> encouraged all the demigods, and they expressed their pleasure and happiness. For a crooked, sinful person there is no scope for <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sayujya" class="d">s&#257;yujya</a>-<a href="/d/mukti" class="d">mukti</a>,</span> or becoming one with the effulgence of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, but because the Supreme Personality of Godhead entered the body of <a href="/d/aghasura" class="d">Agh&#257;sura</a>, by His touch this demon got the opportunity to merge into the existence of the <a href="/d/brahman" class="d">Brahman</a> effulgence and thus attain <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sayujya" class="d">s&#257;yujya</a>-<a href="/d/mukti" class="d">mukti</a>.</span></div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">When this pastime was performed, <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> was only five years old. One year later, when He was six years old and He stepped into the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/pauganda" class="d">pauga&#7751;&#7693;a</a></span> age, this pastime was disclosed to the inhabitants of <a href="/d/vraja" class="d">Vraja</a>. <a href="/d/pariksit" class="d">Par&#299;k&#7779;it</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> inquired, &ldquo;Why is it that this pastime was disclosed only after one year and yet the inhabitants of <a href="/d/vraja" class="d">Vraja</a> thought that it had been performed that very day?&rdquo; With this question, the Twelfth Chapter ends.</div>
