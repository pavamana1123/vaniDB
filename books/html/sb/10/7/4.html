<div class="Translation">&#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; said: When mother Ya&#347;od&#257;&rsquo;s baby was slanting His body to attempt to rise and turn around, this attempt was observed by a Vedic ceremony. In such a ceremony, called <a href="/d/utthana" class="d">utth&#257;na</a>, which is performed when a child is due to leave the house for the first time, the child is properly bathed. Just after <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> turned three months old, mother <a href="/d/yasoda" class="d">Ya&#347;od&#257;</a> celebrated this ceremony with other women of the neighborhood. On that day, there was a conjunction of the moon with the constellation <a href="/d/rohini" class="d">Rohi&#7751;&#299;</a>. As the br&#257;hma&#7751;as joined by chanting Vedic hymns and professional musicians also took part, this great ceremony was observed by mother <a href="/d/yasoda" class="d">Ya&#347;od&#257;</a></div>

<div class="First">There is no question of overpopulation or of children&rsquo;s being a burden for their parents in a Vedic society. Such a society is so well organized and people are so advanced in spiritual consciousness that childbirth is never regarded as a burden or a botheration. The more a child grows, the more his parents become jubilant, and the child&rsquo;s attempts to turn over are also a source of jubilation. Even before the child is born, when the mother is pregnant, many recommended ritualistic ceremonies are performed. For example, when the child has been within the womb for three months and for seven months, there is a ceremony the mother observes by eating with neighboring children. This ceremony is called <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/svada" class="d">sv&#257;da</a>-<a href="/d/bhaksana" class="d">bhak&#7779;a&#7751;a</a>.</span> Similarly, before the birth of the child there is the <span class="Italic">garbh&#257;dh&#257;na</span> ceremony. In Vedic civilization, childbirth or pregnancy is never regarded as a burden; rather, it is a cause for jubilation. In contrast, people in modern civilization do not like pregnancy or childbirth, and when there is a child, they sometimes kill it. We can just consider how human society has fallen since the inauguration of <a href="/d/kali" class="d">Kali</a>-<a href="/d/yuga" class="d">yuga</a>. Although people still claim to be civilized, at the present moment there is actually no human civilization, but only an assembly of two-legged animals.</div>
