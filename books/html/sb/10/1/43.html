<div class="Translation">When the luminaries in the sky, such as the moon, the sun and the stars, are reflected in liquids like oil or water, they appear to be of different shapes&mdash;sometimes round, sometimes long, and so on&mdash;because of the movements of the wind. Similarly, when the living entity, the soul, is absorbed in materialistic thoughts, he accepts various manifestations as his own identity because of ignorance. In other words, one is bewildered by mental concoctions because of agitation from the material modes of nature.</div>

<div class="First">This verse gives a very good example by which to understand the different positions of the eternal spiritual soul in the material world and how the soul takes on different bodies (<span class="Italic"><a href="/d/dehantara" class="d">deh&#257;ntara</a>-<a href="/d/praptih" class="d">pr&#257;pti&#7717;</a></span>). The moon is stationary and is one, but when it is reflected in water or oil, it appears to take different shapes because of the movements of the wind. Similarly, the soul is the eternal servant of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but when put into the material modes of nature, it takes different bodies, sometimes as a demigod, sometimes a man, a dog, a tree and so on. By the influence of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/maya" class="d">m&#257;y&#257;</a>,</span> the illusory potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the living entity thinks that he is this person, that person, American, Indian, cat, dog, tree or whatever. This is called <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/maya" class="d">m&#257;y&#257;</a>.</span> When one is freed from this bewilderment and understands that the soul does not belong to any shape of this material world, one is situated on the spiritual platform (<span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahma" class="d">brahma</a>-<a href="/d/bhuta" class="d">bh&#363;ta</a></span>).</div>
<A NAME="121291"></A><div id="121291"> </div>
<div class="Purport">This realization is sometimes explained as <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/nirakara" class="d">nir&#257;k&#257;ra</a>,</span> or formlessness. This formlessness, however, does not mean that the soul has no form. The soul has form, but the external, agitating form he has acquired because of material contamination is false. Similarly, God is also described as <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/nirakara" class="d">nir&#257;k&#257;ra</a>,</span> which means that God has no material form but is <span class="Italic">sac-cid-<a href="/d/ananda" class="d">&#257;nanda</a>-<a href="/d/vigraha" class="d">vigraha</a></span><I> <span class="Italic"></I>[</I>Bs. </span>5.1</I>]<span class="Italic"></I>.</span> The living entity is part and parcel of the supreme <span class="Italic">sac-cid-<a href="/d/ananda" class="d">&#257;nanda</a>-<a href="/d/vigraha" class="d">vigraha</a>,</span> but his material forms are temporary, or illusory. Both the living entity and the Supreme Lord have original, spiritual forms (<span class="Italic">sac-cid-<a href="/d/ananda" class="d">&#257;nanda</a>-<a href="/d/vigraha" class="d">vigraha</a></span>), but the Lord, the Supreme, does not change His form. The Lord appears as He is, whereas the living entity appears because material nature forces him to accept different forms. When the living entity receives these different forms, he identifies with them, and not with his original, spiritual form. As soon as the living entity returns to his original, spiritual form and understanding, he immediately surrenders to the supreme form, the Personality of Godhead. This is explained in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/7/19?d=1">7.19</a>). <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bahunam" class="d">Bah&#363;n&#257;&#7745;</a> <a href="/d/janmanam" class="d">janman&#257;m</a> <a href="/d/ante" class="d">ante</a> <a href="/d/jnanavan" class="d">j&ntilde;&#257;nav&#257;n</a> <a href="/d/mam" class="d">m&#257;&#7745;</a> <a href="/d/prapadyate" class="d">prapadyate</a>.</span> When the living entity, after many, many births in different forms, returns to his original form of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness, he immediately surrenders unto the lotus feet of the supreme form, <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. This is liberation. As the Lord says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/18/54?d=1">18.54</a>):</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme <a href="/d/brahman" class="d">Brahman</a> and becomes fully joyful.

As long as one is under an impersonal understanding of the Absolute Truth, he is not in pure knowledge, but must still struggle for pure knowledge. <span class="Italic">Kle&#347;o &rsquo;dhikataras <a href="/d/tesam" class="d">te&#7779;&#257;m</a> avyakt&#257;sakta-<a href="/d/cetasam" class="d">cetas&#257;m</a></span> (Bg. <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/12/5?d=1">12.5</a>).

<div class="Purport"><a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> Himself explains the forms of the living entities in the Second Chapter of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a>,</span> where He clearly says to <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> that He, <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> and all other living entities, who were previously in their original forms, are separate individual identities. They were individuals in the past, they are now situated in individuality, and in the future they will all continue to maintain their individual forms. The only difference is that the conditioned living entity appears in various material forms, whereas <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> appears in His original, spiritual form. Unfortunately, those who are not advanced in spiritual knowledge think that <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is like one of them and that His form is like their material forms. <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/avajananti" class="d">Avaj&#257;nanti</a> <a href="/d/mam" class="d">m&#257;&#7745;</a> <a href="/d/mudha" class="d">m&#363;&#7693;h&#257;</a> <a href="/d/manusim" class="d">m&#257;nu&#7779;&#299;&#7745;</a> <a href="/d/tanum" class="d">tanum</a> <a href="/d/asritam" class="d">&#257;&#347;ritam</a></span> (Bg. <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/9/11?d=1">9.11</a>). <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is never puffed up by material knowledge and is therefore called <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/acyuta" class="d">acyuta</a>,</span> whereas the living entities fall down and are agitated by material nature. This is the difference between the Supreme Lord and the living entities.</div>
<A NAME="121295"></A><div id="121295"> </div>
<div class="Purport">In this connection it is to be noted that <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">Vasudeva</a>, who was situated in a transcendental position, advised <a href="/d/kamsa" class="d">Ka&#7745;sa</a> not to commit further sinful activities. <a href="/d/kamsa" class="d">Ka&#7745;sa</a>, a representative of the demons, was always ready to kill <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, or God, whereas <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">Vasudeva</a> represents a transcendentally situated person to whom <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is born (<a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">V&#257;sudeva</a> is the son of <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">Vasudeva</a>). <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">Vasudeva</a> wanted his brother-in-law <a href="/d/kamsa" class="d">Ka&#7745;sa</a> to refrain from the sinful act of killing his sister, since the result of being agitated by material nature would be that <a href="/d/kamsa" class="d">Ka&#7745;sa</a> would have to accept a body in which to suffer again and again. Elsewhere in <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a></span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/5/5/4?d=1">5.5.4</a>), &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva also says:</div>

<div class="After-Verse">As long as the living entity is entangled in the fruitive activities of so-called happiness and distress, he will receive a particular type of body in which to endure the three kinds of suffering due to material nature (<span class="Italic"><a href="/d/tri" class="d">tri</a>-<a href="/d/tapa" class="d">t&#257;pa</a>-yantra&#7751;&#257;</span>). An intelligent person, therefore, must free himself from the influence of the three modes of material nature and revive his original, spiritual body by engaging in the service of the Supreme Person, <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. As long as one is materially attached, one must accept the process of birth, death, old age and disease. One is therefore advised that an intelligent person, instead of being entangled in so-called good and bad fruitive activities, should engage his life in advancing in <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness so that instead of accepting another material body (<span class="Italic"><a href="/d/tyaktva" class="d">tyaktv&#257;</a> <a href="/d/deham" class="d">deha&#7745;</a> <a href="/d/punar" class="d">punar</a> <a href="/d/janma" class="d">janma</a> naiti</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/4/9?d=1">4.9</a>]), he will return home, back to Godhead.</div>
