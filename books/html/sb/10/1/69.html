<div class="Purport">Regarding transmigration of the soul, &#346;r&#299;la Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya gives the following notes. When one is awake, whatever one sees or hears is impressed upon the mind, which later works in dreams to show one different experiences, although in dreams one appears to accept a different body. For example, when one is awake one does business and talks with customers, and similarly in dreams one meets various customers, talks about business and gives quotations. Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya says, therefore, that dreams take place according to what one sees, hears and remembers. When one reawakens, of course, one forgets the body of the dream. This forgetfulness is called <span class="Italic">apasm&#7771;ti.</span> Thus we are changing bodies because we are sometimes dreaming, sometimes awake and sometimes forgetful. Forgetfulness of our previously created body is called death, and our work in the present body is called life. After death, one cannot remember the activities of one&rsquo;s previous body, whether imaginary or factual.</div>

<div class="Purport">The agitated mind is compared to agitated water reflecting the sun and the moon. Actually the sun and moon reflected on the water do not exist there; nonetheless, they are reflected according to the movements of the water. Similarly, when our minds are agitated, we wander in different material atmospheres and receive different types of bodies. This is described in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> as <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/guna" class="d">gu&#7751;a</a>-<a href="/d/sanga" class="d">sa&#7749;ga</a>.</span> <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/karanam" class="d">K&#257;ra&#7751;a&#7745;</a> <a href="/d/guna" class="d">gu&#7751;a</a>-sa&#7749;go &rsquo;sya.</span> Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya says, <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/guna" class="d">gu&#7751;a</a>-nubaddha&#7717; <a href="/d/san" class="d">san</a>.</span> And &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/caitanya" class="d">Caitanya</a> <a href="/d/mahaprabhu" class="d">Mah&#257;prabhu</a> says, <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmanda" class="d">brahm&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a</a> <a href="/d/bhramite" class="d">bhramite</a> <a href="/d/kona" class="d">kona</a> <a href="/d/bhagyavan" class="d">bh&#257;gyav&#257;n</a> <a href="/d/jiva" class="d">j&#299;va</a></span> (Cc. <span class="Ref_Italic"><a href="/d/madhya" class="d">Madhya</a></span> <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/cc/madhya/19/151?d=1">19.151</a>). The living entity rotates up and down throughout the universe, sometimes in the upper planetary system, sometimes in the middle and lower planetary systems, sometimes as a man, sometimes a god, a dog, a tree and so on. This is all due to the agitation of the mind. The mind must therefore be steadily fixed. As it is said, <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sa" class="d">sa</a> <a href="/d/vai" class="d">vai</a> <a href="/d/manah" class="d">mana&#7717;</a> <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>-pad&#257;ravindayo&#7717;.</span> One should fix one&rsquo;s mind at the lotus feet of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, and then one will become free from agitation. This is the instruction of the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/garuda" class="d">Garu&#7693;a</a> <a href="/d/purana" class="d">Pur&#257;&#7751;a</a>,</span> and in the <span class="Italic">N&#257;rad&#299;ya <a href="/d/purana" class="d">Pur&#257;&#7751;a</a></span> the same process is described. As stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a>,</span> <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yanti" class="d">y&#257;nti</a> <a href="/d/deva" class="d">deva</a>-<a href="/d/vrata" class="d">vrat&#257;</a> <a href="/d/devan" class="d">dev&#257;n</a> </I>[Bg. </I><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/9/25?d=1">9.25</a></I>]</I>.</span> The agitated mind goes to different planetary systems because it is attached to different kinds of demigods, but one does not go to the abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead by worshiping the demigods, for this is not supported by any Vedic literature. Man is the architect of his own fortune. In this human life one has the facility with which to understand one&rsquo;s real situation, and one can decide whether to wander around the universe forever or return home, back to Godhead. This is also confirmed in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> (<span class="Italic"><a href="/d/aprapya" class="d">apr&#257;pya</a> <a href="/d/mam" class="d">m&#257;&#7745;</a> <a href="/d/nivartante" class="d">nivartante</a> <a href="/d/mrtyu" class="d">m&#7771;tyu</a>-<a href="/d/samsara" class="d">sa&#7745;s&#257;ra</a>-<a href="/d/vartmani" class="d">vartmani</a></span>).</div>

<div class="Purport">There is no such thing as chance. When a tree is burning in a forest fire and although the nearest tree is spared a distant tree catches fire, this may appear to be chance. Similarly, one may seem to get different types of bodies by chance, but actually one receives these bodies because of the mind. The mind flickers between accepting and rejecting, and according to the acceptance and rejection of the mind, we receive different types of bodies, although we superficially seem to obtain these bodies by chance. Even if we accept the theory of chance, the immediate cause for the change of body is the agitation of the mind.</div>

In this connection, &#346;r&#299;dhara <a href="/d/svami" class="d">Sv&#257;m&#299;</a> says that <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is one hundred percent <a href="/d/bhagavan" class="d">Bhagav&#257;n</a> (<span class="Italic">k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;as <a href="/d/tu" class="d">tu</a> <a href="/d/bhagavan" class="d">bhagav&#257;n</a> <a href="/d/svayam" class="d">svayam</a></span>). Because of our imperfections, however, we cannot appreciate <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> in fullness, and therefore whatever <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> exhibited when present on earth was but a partial manifestation of His opulence. Again, <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> appeared with His plenary expansion <a href="/d/baladeva" class="d">Baladeva</a>. <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, however, is full; there is no question of His appearing partially.

One may have many material desires because of contamination in this material world, but when one is completely free from all material desires, he is called <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/nivrtta" class="d">niv&#7771;tta</a>-<a href="/d/trsna" class="d">t&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>,</span> which indicates that he no longer has any thirst for material enjoyment. <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/svamin" class="d">Sv&#257;min</a> k&#7771;t&#257;rtho &rsquo;smi <a href="/d/varam" class="d">vara&#7745;</a> <a href="/d/na" class="d">na</a> <a href="/d/yace" class="d">y&#257;ce</a></span> (<span class="Italic"><a href="/d/hari" class="d">Hari</a>-<a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">bhakti</a>-sudhodaya</span>). Materialistic persons want some material profit from executing devotional service, but this is not the purpose of service. The perfection of devotional service lies in complete surrender unto the lotus feet of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, with no material desires. One who surrenders in this way is already liberated. <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/jivan" class="d">J&#299;van</a>-<a href="/d/muktah" class="d">mukta&#7717;</a> <a href="/d/sa" class="d">sa</a> <a href="/d/ucyate" class="d">ucyate</a>.</span> One who is always busy serving <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, in whatever condition he may live, is understood to be liberated even in this life. Such a person, who is a pure devotee, does not need to change his body; indeed, he does not possess a material body, for his body has already been spiritualized. An iron rod kept constantly within a fire will ultimately become fire, and whatever it touches will burn. Similarly, the pure devotee is in the fire of spiritual existence, and therefore his body is <span class="Italic">cin-<a href="/d/maya" class="d">maya</a>;</span> that is, it is spiritual, not material, because the pure devotee has no desire but the transcendental desire to serve the Lord. In text four the word <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/upagiyamanat" class="d">upag&#299;yam&#257;n&#257;t</a></span> is used: <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/nivrtta" class="d">niv&#7771;tta</a>-tar&#7779;air <a href="/d/upagiyamanat" class="d">upag&#299;yam&#257;n&#257;t</a>.</span> Who will chant the glories of the Lord unless he is a devotee?

That is His natural reputation. His goodness is unlimited, and He uses it unlimitedly. A devotee is also sometimes described as <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/uttamasloka" class="d">uttama&#347;loka</a>,</span> meaning that he is eager to glorify the Supreme Personality of Godhead or the Lord&rsquo;s devotees. Glorifying the Lord and glorifying the Lord&rsquo;s devotees are the same. Or, rather, glorifying the devotee is more important than glorifying the Lord directly.

Therefore the very sound vibration of the Lord&rsquo;s glorification and name are pleasing to the ears, and by understanding the absolute nature of the Lord&rsquo;s name, form and qualities the devotee becomes joyful. Even those who are not devotees, however, enjoy the pleasing narrations of the Lord&rsquo;s transcendental activities. Even ordinary persons not very much advanced in <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness take pleasure in describing the narrations depicted in <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a>.</span> When a materialistic person is purified in this way, he engages in hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord.

Those who are trying to be liberated, the second class, may regard the chanting and hearing of the Lord&rsquo;s holy name as a process of liberation, and they too will feel the transcendental pleasure of this chanting. As for <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s</span> and persons engaged in sense gratification, they also may take pleasure in hearing the pastimes of the Lord, like His fighting on the Battlefield of <a href="/d/kuruksetra" class="d">Kuruk&#7779;etra</a> and His dancing in <a href="/d/vrndavana" class="d">V&#7771;nd&#257;vana</a> with the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s.</span></div>

According to this verse, devotees like <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> and other residents of &#346;vetadv&#299;pa are seen always engaged in chanting the holy name of the Lord because by such chanting they are always externally and internally blissful.

Devotees, however, always spontaneously hear, chant about and remember the activities of the Lord, and by this process they are fully satisfied, even though these may seem like topics of sense gratification.

<div class="Purport">Formerly an <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/asura" class="d">asura</a></span> named K&#257;lanemi had six sons, named <a href="/d/hamsa" class="d">Ha&#7745;sa</a>, Suvikrama, Kr&#257;tha, <a href="/d/damana" class="d">Damana</a>, Ripurmardana and Krodhahant&#257;.

You have tried to save yourselves from the hands of the demigods, but I curse you in this way: Your father will take birth as <a href="/d/kamsa" class="d">Ka&#7745;sa</a> and kill all of you because you will take birth as sons of <a href="/d/devaki" class="d">Devak&#299;</a>.&rdquo; Because of this curse, the grandsons of Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu had to take birth from the womb of <a href="/d/devaki" class="d">Devak&#299;</a> and be killed by <a href="/d/kamsa" class="d">Ka&#7745;sa</a>, although he was previously their father.
