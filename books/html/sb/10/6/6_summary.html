<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">A summary of the Sixth Chapter is as follows: when <a href="/d/nanda" class="d">Nanda</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a>, following the instructions of <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">Vasudeva</a>, was returning home, he saw a great demoniac woman lying on the road, and then he heard about her death.</div>
</div><A NAME="124048"></A><div id="124048"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">While <a href="/d/nanda" class="d">Nanda</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a>, the King of <a href="/d/vraja" class="d">Vraja</a>, was thinking about Vasudeva&rsquo;s words concerning disturbances in <a href="/d/gokula" class="d">Gokula</a>, he was a little afraid and sought shelter at the lotus feet of &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/hari" class="d">Hari</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="/d/kamsa" class="d">Ka&#7745;sa</a> sent to the village of <a href="/d/gokula" class="d">Gokula</a> a <a href="/d/raksasi" class="d">R&#257;k&#7779;as&#299;</a> named <a href="/d/putana" class="d">P&#363;tan&#257;</a>, who was wandering here and there killing small babies. Of course, wherever there is no <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness, there is the danger of such R&#257;k&#7779;as&#299;s, but since the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself was in <a href="/d/gokula" class="d">Gokula</a>, <a href="/d/putana" class="d">P&#363;tan&#257;</a> could accept nothing there but her own death.</div>
</div><A NAME="124049"></A><div id="124049"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">One day, <a href="/d/putana" class="d">P&#363;tan&#257;</a> arrived from outer space in <a href="/d/gokula" class="d">Gokula</a>, the home of <a href="/d/nanda" class="d">Nanda</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a>, and by displaying her mystic power, she assumed the disguise of a very beautiful woman. Taking courage, she immediately entered K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s bedroom without anyone&rsquo;s permission; by the grace of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, no one forbade her to enter the house or the room, because that was K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s desire. The baby <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, who resembled a fire covered by ashes, looked upon <a href="/d/putana" class="d">P&#363;tan&#257;</a> and thought that He would have to kill this demon, the beautiful woman. Enchanted by the influence of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yogamaya" class="d">yogam&#257;y&#257;</a></span> and the Personality of Godhead, <a href="/d/putana" class="d">P&#363;tan&#257;</a> took <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> upon her lap, and neither <a href="/d/rohini" class="d">Rohi&#7751;&#299;</a> nor <a href="/d/yasoda" class="d">Ya&#347;od&#257;</a> objected. The demon <a href="/d/putana" class="d">P&#363;tan&#257;</a> offered her breast for <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> to suck, but her breast was smeared with poison. The child <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, therefore, squeezed P&#363;tan&#257;&rsquo;s breast so severely that in unbearable pain she had to assume her original body and fell to the ground. Then <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> began playing on her breast just like a small child. When <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> was playing, the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> were pacified and took the child away to their own laps. After this incident, the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> took precautions because of the attack of the <a href="/d/raksasi" class="d">R&#257;k&#7779;as&#299;</a>. Mother <a href="/d/yasoda" class="d">Ya&#347;od&#257;</a> gave the child her breast to suck and then laid Him in bed.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Meanwhile, <a href="/d/nanda" class="d">Nanda</a> and his associates the cowherd men returned from <a href="/d/mathura" class="d">Mathur&#257;</a>, and when they saw the great dead body of <a href="/d/putana" class="d">P&#363;tan&#257;</a>, they were struck with wonder. Everyone was astonished that <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">Vasudeva</a> had foretold this mishap, and they praised <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">Vasudeva</a> for his power of foresight. The inhabitants of <a href="/d/vraja" class="d">Vraja</a> cut the gigantic body of <a href="/d/putana" class="d">P&#363;tan&#257;</a> into pieces, but because <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> had sucked her breast, she had been freed from all sins, and therefore when the cowherd men burned the pieces of her body in a fire, the smoke filled the air with a very pleasing fragrance. Ultimately, although <a href="/d/putana" class="d">P&#363;tan&#257;</a> had desired to kill <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, she attained the Lord&rsquo;s abode. From this incident we gain the instruction that if one is attached to <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> somehow or other, even as an enemy, one ultimately attains success. What then is to be said of devotees who are naturally attached to <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> in love? When the inhabitants of <a href="/d/vraja" class="d">Vraja</a> heard about the killing of <a href="/d/putana" class="d">P&#363;tan&#257;</a> and the welfare of the child, they were very much satisfied. <a href="/d/nanda" class="d">Nanda</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> took the baby <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> on his lap and was filled with satisfaction.</div>
