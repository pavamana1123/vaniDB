<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">The summary of the Eighth Chapter is as follows. This chapter describes the ceremony of giving a name to <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. It also describes His crawling, His playing with the cows, and His eating earth and again showing the universal form to His mother.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">One day, <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">Vasudeva</a> sent for Gargamuni, the family priest of the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yadu" class="d">yadu</a>-<a href="/d/vamsa" class="d">va&#7745;&#347;a</a>,</span> and thus Gargamuni went to the house of <a href="/d/nanda" class="d">Nanda</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a>, who received him very well and requested him to give names to <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> and <a href="/d/balarama" class="d">Balar&#257;ma</a>. Gargamuni, of course, reminded <a href="/d/nanda" class="d">Nanda</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> that <a href="/d/kamsa" class="d">Ka&#7745;sa</a> was looking for the son of <a href="/d/devaki" class="d">Devak&#299;</a> and said that if he performed the ceremony very gorgeously, the ceremony would come to the notice of <a href="/d/kamsa" class="d">Ka&#7745;sa</a>, who would then suspect that <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> was the son of <a href="/d/devaki" class="d">Devak&#299;</a>. <a href="/d/nanda" class="d">Nanda</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> therefore requested Gargamuni to perform this ceremony without anyone&rsquo;s knowledge, and Gargamuni did so. Because <a href="/d/balarama" class="d">Balar&#257;ma</a>, the son of <a href="/d/rohini" class="d">Rohi&#7751;&#299;</a>, increases the transcendental bliss of others, His name is <a href="/d/rama" class="d">R&#257;ma</a>, and because of His extraordinary strength, He is called <a href="/d/baladeva" class="d">Baladeva</a>. He attracts the Yadus to follow His instructions, and therefore His name is <a href="/d/sankarsana" class="d">Sa&#7749;kar&#7779;a&#7751;a</a>. <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, the son of <a href="/d/yasoda" class="d">Ya&#347;od&#257;</a>, previously appeared in many other colors, such as white, red and yellow, and He had now assumed the color black. Because He was sometimes the son of <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">Vasudeva</a>, His name is <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">V&#257;sudeva</a>. According to His various activities and qualities, He has many other names. After thus informing <a href="/d/nanda" class="d">Nanda</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> and completing the name-giving ceremony, Gargamuni advised <a href="/d/nanda" class="d">Nanda</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> to protect his son very carefully and then departed.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">&#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; next described how the two children crawled, walked on Their small legs, played with the cows and calves, stole butter and other milk products and broke the butter pots. In this way, he described many naughty activities of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> and <a href="/d/balarama" class="d">Balar&#257;ma</a>. The most wonderful of these occurred when K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s playmates complained to mother <a href="/d/yasoda" class="d">Ya&#347;od&#257;</a> that <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> was eating earth. Mother <a href="/d/yasoda" class="d">Ya&#347;od&#257;</a> wanted to open K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s mouth to see the evidence so that she could chastise Him. Sometimes she assumed the position of a chastising mother, and at the next moment she was overwhelmed with maternal love. After describing all this to <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/pariksit" class="d">Par&#299;k&#7779;it</a>, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, at <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> Par&#299;k&#7779;it&rsquo;s request, praised the fortune of mother <a href="/d/yasoda" class="d">Ya&#347;od&#257;</a> and <a href="/d/nanda" class="d">Nanda</a>. <a href="/d/nanda" class="d">Nanda</a> and <a href="/d/yasoda" class="d">Ya&#347;od&#257;</a> were formerly <a href="/d/drona" class="d">Dro&#7751;a</a> and <a href="/d/dhara" class="d">Dhar&#257;</a>, and by the order of <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> they came to this earth and had the Supreme Personality of Godhead as their son.</div>
