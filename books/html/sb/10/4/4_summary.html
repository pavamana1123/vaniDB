<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">This chapter describes how <a href="/d/kamsa" class="d">Ka&#7745;sa</a>, following the advice of his demoniac friends, considered the persecution of small children to be very diplomatic.</div>
</div><A NAME="123049"></A><div id="123049"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">After <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">Vasudeva</a> bound himself with iron shackles as before, all the doors of the prison house closed by the influence of <a href="/d/yogamaya" class="d">Yogam&#257;y&#257;</a>, who then began crying as a newborn child, This crying awakened the doorkeepers, who immediately informed <a href="/d/kamsa" class="d">Ka&#7745;sa</a> that a child had been born to <a href="/d/devaki" class="d">Devak&#299;</a>. Upon hearing this news, <a href="/d/kamsa" class="d">Ka&#7745;sa</a> appeared with great force in the maternity room, and in spite of Devak&#299;&rsquo;s pleas that the child be saved, the demon forcibly snatched the child from Devak&#299;&rsquo;s hands and dashed the child against a rock. Unfortunately for <a href="/d/kamsa" class="d">Ka&#7745;sa</a>, however, the newborn child slipped away from his hands, <a href="/d/rose" class="d">rose</a> above his head and appeared as the eight-armed form of <a href="/d/durga" class="d">Durg&#257;</a>. <a href="/d/durga" class="d">Durg&#257;</a> then told <a href="/d/kamsa" class="d">Ka&#7745;sa</a>, &ldquo;The enemy you contemplate has taken birth somewhere else. Therefore your plan to persecute all the children will prove futile.&rdquo;</div>
</div><A NAME="123050"></A><div id="123050"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">According to the prophecy, the eighth child of <a href="/d/devaki" class="d">Devak&#299;</a> would kill <a href="/d/kamsa" class="d">Ka&#7745;sa</a>, and therefore when <a href="/d/kamsa" class="d">Ka&#7745;sa</a> saw that the eighth child was a female and heard that his so-called enemy had taken birth elsewhere, he was struck with wonder. He decided to release <a href="/d/devaki" class="d">Devak&#299;</a> and <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">Vasudeva</a>, and he admitted before them the wrongness of his atrocities. Falling at the feet of <a href="/d/devaki" class="d">Devak&#299;</a> and <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">Vasudeva</a>, he begged their pardon and tried to convince them that because the events that had taken place were destined to happen, they should not be unhappy for his having killed so many of their children. <a href="/d/devaki" class="d">Devak&#299;</a> and <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">Vasudeva</a>, being naturally very pious, immediately excused <a href="/d/kamsa" class="d">Ka&#7745;sa</a> for his atrocities, and <a href="/d/kamsa" class="d">Ka&#7745;sa</a>, after seeing that his sister and brother-in-law were happy, returned to his home.</div>
</div><A NAME="123051"></A><div id="123051"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">After the night passed, however, <a href="/d/kamsa" class="d">Ka&#7745;sa</a> called for his ministers and informed them of all that had happened. The ministers, who were all demons, advised <a href="/d/kamsa" class="d">Ka&#7745;sa</a> that because his enemy had already taken birth somewhere else, all the children born within the past ten days in the villages within Ka&#7745;sa&rsquo;s kingdom should be killed. Although the demigods always feared <a href="/d/kamsa" class="d">Ka&#7745;sa</a>, they should not be treated leniently; since they were enemies, <a href="/d/kamsa" class="d">Ka&#7745;sa</a> should try his best to uproot their existence. The demoniac ministers further advised that <a href="/d/kamsa" class="d">Ka&#7745;sa</a> and the demons continue their enmity toward <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a> because <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a> is the original person among all the demigods. The <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> the cows, the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> austerity, truthfulness, control of the senses and mind, faithfulness and mercy are among the different parts of the body of <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a>, who is the origin of all the demigods, including Lord <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> and Lord &#346;iva. Therefore, the ministers advised, the demigods, the saintly persons, the cows and the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> should be systematically persecuted. Strongly advised in this way by his friends, the demoniac ministers, <a href="/d/kamsa" class="d">Ka&#7745;sa</a> approved of their instructions and considered it beneficial to be envious of the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as.</span> Following Ka&#7745;sa&rsquo;s orders, therefore, the demons began committing their atrocities all over Vrajabh&#363;mi.</div>
