<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">This chapter describes how <a href="/d/bali" class="d">Bali</a>, after performing the <a href="/d/visvajit" class="d">Vi&#347;vajit</a>-<a href="/d/yajna" class="d">yaj&ntilde;a</a>, received the benediction of a chariot and various kinds of paraphernalia for war, with which he attacked the King of heaven. All the demigods, being afraid of him, left the heavenly planets and went away, following the instructions of their <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/guru" class="d">guru</a>.</span></div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level"><a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/pariksit" class="d">Par&#299;k&#7779;it</a> wanted to understand how Lord V&#257;manadeva, on the plea of taking three paces of land from <a href="/d/bali" class="d">Bali</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a>, took everything away from him and arrested him. &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; responded to this inquiry with the following explanation. In the fight between the demons and the demigods, as described in the Eleventh Chapter of this canto, <a href="/d/bali" class="d">Bali</a> was defeated, and he died in the fight, but by the grace of &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya he regained his life. Thus he engaged himself in the service of &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya, his spiritual master. The descendants of <a href="/d/bhrgu" class="d">Bh&#7771;gu</a>, being pleased with him, engaged him in the <a href="/d/visvajit" class="d">Vi&#347;vajit</a>-<a href="/d/yajna" class="d">yaj&ntilde;a</a>. When this <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yajna" class="d">yaj&ntilde;a</a></span> was performed, from the fire of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yajna" class="d">yaj&ntilde;a</a></span> came a chariot, horses, a flag, a bow, armor and two quivers of arrows. <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/prahlada" class="d">Prahl&#257;da</a>, <a href="/d/bali" class="d">Bali</a> Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s grandfather, gave <a href="/d/bali" class="d">Bali</a> an eternal garland of flowers, and &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya gave him a conchshell. <a href="/d/bali" class="d">Bali</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a>, after offering obeisances to <a href="/d/prahlada" class="d">Prahl&#257;da</a>, the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and his spiritual master, &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya, equipped himself to fight with <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a> and went to Indrapur&#299; with his soldiers. Blowing his conchshell, he attacked the outskirts of Indra&rsquo;s kingdom. When <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a> saw <a href="/d/bali" class="d">Bali</a> Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s prowess, he went to his own spiritual master, <a href="/d/brhaspati" class="d">B&#7771;haspati</a>, told him about Bali&rsquo;s strength, and inquired about his duty. <a href="/d/brhaspati" class="d">B&#7771;haspati</a> informed the demigods that because <a href="/d/bali" class="d">Bali</a> had been endowed with extraordinary power by the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> the demigods could not fight with him. Their only hope was to gain the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Indeed, there was no alternative. Under the circumstances, <a href="/d/brhaspati" class="d">B&#7771;haspati</a> advised the demigods to leave the heavenly planets and keep themselves somewhere invisible. The demigods followed his orders, and <a href="/d/bali" class="d">Bali</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a>, along with his associates, gained the entire kingdom of <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a>. The descendants of <a href="/d/bhrgu" class="d">Bh&#7771;gu</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a>, being very affectionate to their disciple <a href="/d/bali" class="d">Bali</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a>, engaged him in performing one hundred <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/asvamedha" class="d">a&#347;vamedha</a>-yaj&ntilde;as.</span> In this way, <a href="/d/bali" class="d">Bali</a> enjoyed the opulences of the heavenly planets.</div>
