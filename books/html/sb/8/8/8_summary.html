<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">This chapter describes how the goddess of fortune appeared during the churning of the ocean of milk and how she accepted Lord <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a> as her husband. As described later in the chapter, when Dhanvantari appeared with a pot of nectar the demons immediately snatched it from him, but Lord <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a> appeared as the incarnation <a href="/d/mohini" class="d">Mohin&#299;</a>, the most beautiful woman in the world, just to captivate the demons and save the nectar for the demigods.</div>
</div><A NAME="100344"></A><div id="100344"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">After Lord &#346;iva drank all the poison, both the demigods and demons took courage and resumed their activities of churning. Because of this churning, first a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/surabhi" class="d">surabhi</a></span> cow was produced. Great saintly persons accepted this cow to derive clarified butter from its milk and offer this clarified butter in oblations for great sacrifices. Thereafter, a horse named Uccai&#7717;&#347;rav&#257; was generated. This horse was taken by <a href="/d/bali" class="d">Bali</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a>. Then there appeared Air&#257;vata and other elephants that could go anywhere in any direction, and she-elephants also appeared. The gem known as <a href="/d/kaustubha" class="d">Kaustubha</a> was also generated, and Lord <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a> took that gem and placed it on His chest. Thereafter, a <span class="Italic">p&#257;rij&#257;ta</span> flower and the Apsar&#257;s, the most beautiful women in the universe, were generated. Then the goddess of fortune, <a href="/d/laksmi" class="d">Lak&#7779;m&#299;</a>, appeared. The demigods, great sages, Gandharvas and others offered her their respectful worship. The goddess of fortune could not find anyone to accept as her husband. At last she selected Lord <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a> to be her master. Lord <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a> gave her a place to stay everlastingly at His chest. Because of this combination of <a href="/d/laksmi" class="d">Lak&#7779;m&#299;</a> and <a href="/d/narayana" class="d">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</a>, all who were present, including the demigods and people in general, were very pleased. The demons, however, being neglected by the goddess of fortune, were very depressed. Then <a href="/d/varuni" class="d">V&#257;ru&#7751;&#299;</a>, the goddess of drinking, was generated, and by the order of Lord <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a> the demons accepted her. Then the demons and demigods, with renewed energy, began to churn again. This time a partial incarnation of Lord <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a> called Dhanvantari appeared. He was very beautiful, and he carried a jug containing nectar. The demons immediately snatched the jug from Dhanvantari&rsquo;s hand and began to run away, and the demigods, being very morose, took shelter of <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a>. After the demons snatched the jug from Dhanvantari, they began to fight among themselves. Lord <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a> solaced the demigods, who therefore did not fight, but remained silent. While the fighting was going on among the demons, the Lord Himself appeared as the incarnation <a href="/d/mohini" class="d">Mohin&#299;</a>, the most beautiful woman in the universe.</div>
