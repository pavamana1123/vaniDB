<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">The Second, Third and Fourth Chapters of this canto describe how the Lord, during the reign of the fourth <a href="/d/manu" class="d">Manu</a>, gave protection to the king of the elephants. As described in this Second Chapter, when the King of the elephants, along with his female elephants, was enjoying in the water, a crocodile suddenly attacked him, and the elephant surrendered to the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead for protection.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">In the midst of the ocean of milk, there is a very high and beautiful mountain that has an altitude of ten thousand <span class="Italic">yojanas,</span> or eighty thousand miles. This mountain is known as <a href="/d/trikuta" class="d">Trik&#363;&#7789;a</a>. In a valley of <a href="/d/trikuta" class="d">Trik&#363;&#7789;a</a> there is a nice garden named &#7770;tumat, which was constructed by <a href="/d/varuna" class="d">Varu&#7751;a</a>, and in that area there is a very nice lake. Once the chief of the elephants, along with female elephants, went to enjoy bathing in that lake, and they disturbed the inhabitants of the water. Because of this, the chief crocodile in that water, who was very powerful, immediately attacked the elephant&rsquo;s leg. Thus there ensued a great fight between the elephant and the crocodile. This fight continued for one thousand years. Neither the elephant nor the crocodile died, but since they were in the water, the elephant gradually became weak whereas the power of the crocodile increased more and more. Thus the crocodile became more and more encouraged. Then the elephant, being helpless and seeing that there was no other way for his protection, sought shelter at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
