<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">As described in this chapter, the great saint <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a>, being very compassionate to the demons who had been killed by the demigods, forbade the demigods to continue killing. Then &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya, by his mystic power, renewed the lives of all the demons.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Having been graced by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the demigods began fighting the demons again, with renewed energy. King <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a> released his thunderbolt against <a href="/d/bali" class="d">Bali</a>, and when <a href="/d/bali" class="d">Bali</a> fell, his friend Jambh&#257;sura attacked <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a>, who then cut off Jambh&#257;sura&rsquo;s head with his thunderbolt. When <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> learned that Jambh&#257;sura had been killed, he informed Jambh&#257;sura&rsquo;s relatives <a href="/d/namuci" class="d">Namuci</a>, <a href="/d/bala" class="d">Bala</a> and <a href="/d/paka" class="d">P&#257;ka</a>, who then went to the battlefield and attacked the demigods. <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a>, King of heaven, severed the heads of <a href="/d/bala" class="d">Bala</a> and <a href="/d/paka" class="d">P&#257;ka</a> and released the weapon known as <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/kulisa" class="d">kuli&#347;a</a>,</span> the thunderbolt, against Namuci&rsquo;s shoulder. The thunderbolt, however, returned unsuccessful, and thus <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a> became morose. At that time, an unseen voice came from the sky. The voice declared, &ldquo;A dry or wet weapon cannot kill <a href="/d/namuci" class="d">Namuci</a>.&rdquo; Hearing this voice, <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a> began to think of how <a href="/d/namuci" class="d">Namuci</a> could be killed. He then thought of foam, which is neither moist nor dry. Using a weapon of foam, he was able to kill <a href="/d/namuci" class="d">Namuci</a>. Thus <a href="/d/indra" class="d">Indra</a> and the other demigods killed many demons. Then, at the request of Lord <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a>, <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> went to the demigods and forbade them to kill the demons any longer. All the demigods then returned to their abodes. Following the instructions of <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a>, whatever demons remained alive on the battlefield took <a href="/d/bali" class="d">Bali</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> to <a href="/d/asta" class="d">Asta</a> Mountain. There, by the touch of &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya&rsquo;s hand, <a href="/d/bali" class="d">Bali</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> regained his senses and consciousness, and those demons whose heads and bodies had not been completely lost were brought back to life by the mystic power of &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya.</div>
