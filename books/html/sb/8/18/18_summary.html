<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">This chapter describes how Lord V&#257;manadeva appeared and how He went to the sacrificial arena of <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/bali" class="d">Bali</a>, who received Him well and fulfilled His desire by offering Him benedictions.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Lord V&#257;manadeva appeared in this world from the womb of Aditi completely equipped with conchshell, disc, club and lotus. His bodily hue was blackish, and He was dressed in yellow garments. Lord <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a> appeared at an auspicious moment on &#346;rava&#7751;a-<a href="/d/dvadasi" class="d">dv&#257;da&#347;&#299;</a> when the <a href="/d/abhijit" class="d">Abhijit</a> star had arisen. At that time, in all the three worlds (including the higher planetary system, outer space and this earth), all the demigods, the cows, the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and even the seasons were happy because of God&rsquo;s appearance. Therefore this auspicious day is called <a href="/d/vijaya" class="d">Vijay&#257;</a>. When the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who has a <span class="Italic">sac-cid-<a href="/d/ananda" class="d">&#257;nanda</a></span> body, appeared as the son of <a href="/d/kasyapa" class="d">Ka&#347;yapa</a> and Aditi, both of His parents were very astonished. After His appearance, the Lord assumed the form of a dwarf (<a href="/d/vamana" class="d">V&#257;mana</a>). All the great sages expressed their jubilation, and with <a href="/d/kasyapa" class="d">Ka&#347;yapa</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a> before them they performed the birthday ceremony of Lord <a href="/d/vamana" class="d">V&#257;mana</a>. At the time of Lord V&#257;manadeva&rsquo;s sacred thread ceremony, He was honored by the sun-god, <a href="/d/brhaspati" class="d">B&#7771;haspati</a>, the goddess presiding over the planet earth, the deity of the heavenly planets, His mother, Lord <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a>, <a href="/d/kuvera" class="d">Kuvera</a>, the seven <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;is</span> and others. Lord V&#257;manadeva then visited the sacrificial arena on the northern side of the <a href="/d/narmada" class="d">Narmad&#257;</a> River, at the field known as <a href="/d/bhrgukaccha" class="d">Bh&#7771;gukaccha</a>, where <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> of the <a href="/d/bhrgu" class="d">Bh&#7771;gu</a> dynasty were performing <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;as.</span> Wearing a belt made of <span class="Italic">mu&ntilde;ja</span> straw, an upper garment of deerskin and a sacred thread and carrying in His hands a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/danda" class="d">da&#7751;&#7693;a</a>,</span> an umbrella and a waterpot (<span class="Italic"><a href="/d/kamandalu" class="d">kama&#7751;&#7693;alu</a></span>), Lord V&#257;manadeva appeared in the sacrificial arena of <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/bali" class="d">Bali</a>. Because of His transcendentally effulgent presence, all the priests were diminished in their prowess, and thus they all stood from their seats and offered prayers to Lord V&#257;manadeva. Even Lord &#346;iva accepts on his head the Ganges water generated from the toe of Lord V&#257;manadeva. Therefore, after washing the Lord&rsquo;s feet, <a href="/d/bali" class="d">Bali</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> immediately accepted the water from the Lord&rsquo;s feet on his head and felt that he and his predecessors had certainly been glorified. Then <a href="/d/bali" class="d">Bali</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> inquired of Lord V&#257;manadeva&rsquo;s welfare and requested the Lord to ask him for money, jewels or anything He might desire.</div>
