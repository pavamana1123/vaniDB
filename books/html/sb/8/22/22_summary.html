<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">The summary of this Twenty-second Chapter is as follows. The Supreme Personality of Godhead was pleased by the behavior of <a href="/d/bali" class="d">Bali</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a>. Thus the Lord placed him on the planet <a href="/d/sutala" class="d">Sutala</a>, and there, after bestowing benedictions upon him, the Lord agreed to become his doorman.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level"><a href="/d/bali" class="d">Bali</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> was extremely truthful. Being unable to keep his promise, he was very much afraid, for he knew that one who has deviated from truthfulness is insignificant in the eyes of society. An exalted person can suffer the consequences of hellish life, but he is very much afraid of being defamed for deviation from the truth. <a href="/d/bali" class="d">Bali</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> agreed with great pleasure to accept the punishment awarded him by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In <a href="/d/bali" class="d">Bali</a> Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s dynasty there were many <span class="Italic">asuras</span> who because of their enmity toward <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a> had achieved a destination more exalted than that of many mystic <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s.</span> <a href="/d/bali" class="d">Bali</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> specifically remembered the determination of <a href="/d/prahlada" class="d">Prahl&#257;da</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> in devotional service. Considering all these points, he decided to give his head in charity as the place for Vi&#7779;&#7751;u&rsquo;s third step. <a href="/d/bali" class="d">Bali</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> also considered how great personalities give up their family relationships and material possessions to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Indeed, they sometimes even sacrifice their lives for the satisfaction of the Lord, just to become His personal servants. Accordingly, by following in the footsteps of previous <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas</span> and devotees, <a href="/d/bali" class="d">Bali</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> perceived himself successful.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">While <a href="/d/bali" class="d">Bali</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a>, having been arrested by the ropes of <a href="/d/varuna" class="d">Varu&#7751;a</a>, was offering prayers to the Lord, his grandfather <a href="/d/prahlada" class="d">Prahl&#257;da</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> appeared there and described how the Supreme Personality of Godhead had delivered <a href="/d/bali" class="d">Bali</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> by taking his possessions in a tricky way. While <a href="/d/prahlada" class="d">Prahl&#257;da</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> was present, Lord <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> and Bali&rsquo;s wife, Vindhy&#257;vali, described the supremacy of the Supreme Lord. Since <a href="/d/bali" class="d">Bali</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> had given everything to the Lord, they prayed for his release. The Lord then described how a nondevotee&rsquo;s possession of wealth is a danger whereas a devotee&rsquo;s opulence is a benediction from the Lord. Then, being pleased with <a href="/d/bali" class="d">Bali</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a>, the Supreme Lord offered His disc to protect <a href="/d/bali" class="d">Bali</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> and promised to remain with him.</div>
