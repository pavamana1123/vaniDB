<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">The summary of the Seventh Chapter is as follows. As described in this chapter, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, appearing in His incarnation as a tortoise, dove deep into the ocean to carry <a href="/d/mandara" class="d">Mandara</a> Mountain on His back. At first the churning of the ocean produced <span class="Italic">k&#257;lak&#363;&#7789;a</span> poison. Everyone feared this poison, but Lord &#346;iva satisfied them by drinking it.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">With the understanding that when the nectar was generated from the churning they would share it equally, the demigods and the demons brought <a href="/d/vasuki" class="d">V&#257;suki</a> to be used as the rope for the churning rod. By the expert arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the demons held the snake near the mouth, whereas the demigods held the tail of the great snake. Then, with great endeavor, they began pulling the snake in both directions. Because the churning rod, <a href="/d/mandara" class="d">Mandara</a> Mountain, was very heavy and was not held by any support in the water, it sank into the ocean, and in this way the prowess of both the demons and the demigods was vanquished. The Supreme Personality of Godhead then appeared in the form of a tortoise and supported <a href="/d/mandara" class="d">Mandara</a> Mountain on His back. Then the churning resumed with great force. As a result of the churning, a huge amount of poison was produced. The <span class="Italic">praj&#257;patis,</span> seeing no one else to save them, approached Lord &#346;iva and offered him prayers full of truth. Lord &#346;iva is called &#256;&#347;uto&#7779;a because he is very pleased if one is a devotee. Therefore he easily agreed to drink all the poison generated by the churning. The goddess <a href="/d/durga" class="d">Durg&#257;</a>, <a href="/d/bhavani" class="d">Bhav&#257;n&#299;</a>, the wife of Lord &#346;iva, was not at all disturbed when Lord &#346;iva agreed to drink the poison, for she knew Lord &#346;iva&rsquo;s prowess. Indeed, she expressed her pleasure at this agreement. Then Lord &#346;iva gathered the devastating poison, which was everywhere. He took it in his hand and drank it. After he drank the poison, his neck became bluish. A small quantity of the poison dropped from his hands to the ground, and it is because of this poison that there are poisonous snakes, scorpions, toxic plants and other poisonous things in this world.</div>
