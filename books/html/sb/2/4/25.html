<div class="Translation">My dear King, <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a>, the firstborn, on being questioned by <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a>, exactly apprised him on this subject, as it was directly spoken by the Lord to His own son, who was impregnated with Vedic knowledge from his very birth.</div>
<A NAME="24488"></A><div id="24488"> </div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<A NAME="24489"></A><div id="24489"> </div>
<div class="First">As soon as <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> was born of the abdominal lotus petals of <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a>, he was impregnated with Vedic knowledge, and therefore he is known as <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/veda" class="d">veda</a>-<a href="/d/garbha" class="d">garbha</a>,</span> or a Ved&#257;ntist from the embryo. Without Vedic knowledge, or perfect, infallible knowledge, no one can create anything. All scientific knowledge and perfect knowledge are Vedic. One can get all types of information from the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> and as such, <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> was impregnated with all-perfect knowledge so that it was possible for him to create. Thus <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> knew the perfect description of creation, as it was exactly apprised to him by the Supreme Lord <a href="/d/hari" class="d">Hari</a>. <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a>, on being questioned by <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a>, told <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> exactly what he had heard directly from the Lord. <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> again told exactly the same thing to <a href="/d/vyasa" class="d">Vy&#257;sa</a>, and <a href="/d/vyasa" class="d">Vy&#257;sa</a> also told &#346;ukadeva exactly what he heard from <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a>. And &#346;ukadeva was going to repeat the same statements as he had heard them from <a href="/d/vyasa" class="d">Vy&#257;sa</a>. That is the way of Vedic understanding. The language of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> can be revealed only by the above-mentioned disciplic succession, and not otherwise.</div>
<A NAME="24490"></A><div id="24490"> </div>
<div class="Purport">There is no use in theories. Knowledge must be factual. There are many things that are complicated, and one cannot understand them unless they are explained by one who knows. The Vedic knowledge is also very difficult to know and must be learned by the above-mentioned system; otherwise it is not at all understood.</div>
<A NAME="24491"></A><div id="24491"> </div>
<div class="Purport">&#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, therefore, prayed for the mercy of the Lord so that he might be able to repeat the very same message that was spoken directly by the Lord to <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a>, or what was directly spoken by <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> to <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a>. Therefore the statements of creation explained by &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; are not at all, as the mundaners suggest, theoretical, but are perfectly correct. One who hears these messages and tries to assimilate them gets perfect information of the material creation.</div>
