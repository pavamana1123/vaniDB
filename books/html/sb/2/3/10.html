<div class="First">The Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is described in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span> as <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/purusottama" class="d">puru&#7779;ottama</a>,</span> or the Supreme Personality. It is He only who can award liberation to the impersonalists by absorbing such aspirants in the <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti,</span> the bodily rays of the Lord. The <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti</span> is not separate from the Lord, as the glowing sun ray is not independent of the sun disc. Therefore one who desires to merge into the supreme impersonal <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti</span> must also worship the Lord by <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">bhakti</a>-<a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a>,</span> as recommended here in the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a>.</span> <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">Bhakti</a>-<a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> is especially stressed here as the means of all perfection. In the previous chapters it has been stated that <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">bhakti</a>-<a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> is the ultimate goal of both <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/karma" class="d">karma</a>-<a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> and <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/jnana" class="d">j&ntilde;&#257;na</a>-<a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a>,</span> and in the same way in this chapter it is emphatically declared that <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">bhakti</a>-<a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> is the ultimate goal of the different varieties of worship of the different demigods. <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">Bhakti</a>-<a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a>,</span> thus being the supreme means of self-realization, is recommended here. Everyone must therefore seriously take up the methods of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">bhakti</a>-<a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a>,</span> even though one aspires for material enjoyment or liberation from material bondage.</div>

<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic"><a href="/d/akamah" class="d">Ak&#257;ma&#7717;</a></span> is one who has no material desire. A living being, naturally being the part and parcel of the supreme whole <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/purusam" class="d">puru&#7779;a&#7745;</a> <a href="/d/purnam" class="d">p&#363;r&#7751;am</a>,</span> has as his natural function to serve the Supreme Being, just as the parts and parcels of the body, or the limbs of the body, are naturally meant to serve the complete body. Desireless means, therefore, not to be inert like the stone, but to be conscious of one's actual position and thus desire satisfaction only from the Supreme Lord. &#346;r&#299;la <a href="/d/jiva" class="d">J&#299;va</a> Gosv&#257;m&#299; has explained this desirelessness as <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhajaniya" class="d">bhajan&#299;ya</a>-<a href="/d/parama" class="d">parama</a>-<a href="/d/purusa" class="d">puru&#7779;a</a>-<a href="/d/sukha" class="d">sukha</a>-<a href="/d/matra" class="d">m&#257;tra</a>-<a href="/d/sva" class="d">sva</a>-sukhatvam</span> in his <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sandarbha" class="d">Sandarbha</a>.</span> This means that one should feel happy only by experiencing the happiness of the Supreme Lord. This intuition of the living being is sometimes manifested even during the conditioned stage of a living being in the material world, and such intuition is expressed in the manner of altruism, philanthropy, socialism, communism, etc., by the undeveloped minds of less intelligent persons. In the mundane field such an outlook of doing good to others in the form of society, community, family, country or humanity is a partial manifestation of the same original feeling in which a pure living entity feels happiness by the happiness of the Supreme Lord. Such superb feelings were exhibited by the damsels of Vrajabh&#363;mi for the happiness of the Lord. The <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> loved the Lord without any return, and this is the perfect exhibition of the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/akamah" class="d">ak&#257;ma&#7717;</a></span> spirit. <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/kama" class="d">K&#257;ma</a></span> spirit, or the desire for one's own satisfaction, is fully exhibited in the material world, whereas the spirit of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/akamah" class="d">ak&#257;ma&#7717;</a></span> is fully exhibited in the spiritual world.</div>
<A NAME="23816"></A><div id="23816"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Thoughts of becoming one with the Lord, or being merged in the <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti,</span> can also be exhibitions of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/kama" class="d">k&#257;ma</a></span> spirit if they are desires for one's own satisfaction to be free from the material miseries. A pure devotee does not want liberation so that he may be relieved from the miseries of life. Even without so-called liberation, a pure devotee is aspirant for the satisfaction of the Lord. Influenced by the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/kama" class="d">k&#257;ma</a></span> spirit, <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> declined to fight in the <a href="/d/kuruksetra" class="d">Kuruk&#7779;etra</a> battlefield because he wanted to save his relatives for his own satisfaction. But being a pure devotee, he agreed to fight on the instruction of the Lord because he came to his senses and realized that satisfaction of the Lord at the cost of his own satisfaction was his prime duty. Thus he became <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/akama" class="d">ak&#257;ma</a>.</span> That is the perfect stage of a perfect living being.</div>
<A NAME="23817"></A><div id="23817"> </div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic"><a href="/d/udara" class="d">Ud&#257;ra</a>-<a href="/d/dhih" class="d">dh&#299;&#7717;</a></span> means one who has a broader outlook. people with desires for material enjoyment worship small demigods, and such intelligence is condemned in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span></B> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/7/20?d=1">7.20</a>) as <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/hrta" class="d">h&#7771;ta</a> <a href="/d/jnana" class="d">j&ntilde;&#257;na</a>,</span> the intelligence of one who has lost his senses. One cannot obtain any result from demigods without getting sanction from the Supreme Lord. Therefore a person with a broader outlook can see that the ultimate authority is the Lord, even for material benefits. Under the circumstances, one with a broader outlook, even with the desire for material enjoyment or for liberation, should take to the worship of the Lord directly. And everyone, whether an <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/akama" class="d">ak&#257;ma</a></span> or <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sakama" class="d">sak&#257;ma</a></span> or <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/moksa" class="d">mok&#7779;a</a>-<a href="/d/kama" class="d">k&#257;ma</a>,</span> should worship the Lord with great expedience. This implies that <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">bhakti</a>-<a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> may be perfectly administered without any mixture of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/karma" class="d">karma</a></span> and <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/jnana" class="d">j&ntilde;&#257;na</a>.</span> As the unmixed sun ray is very forceful and is therefore called <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/tivra" class="d">t&#299;vra</a>,</span> similarly unmixed <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">bhakti</a>-<a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> of hearing, chanting, etc., may be performed by one and all regardless of inner motive.</div>
