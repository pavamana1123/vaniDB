<div class="Translation">However, O King, if a <a href="/d/yogi" class="d">yog&#299;</a> maintains a desire for improved material enjoyments, like transference to the topmost planet, Brahmaloka, or the achievement of the eightfold perfections, travel in outer space with the Vaih&#257;yasas, or a situation in one of the millions of planets, then he has to take away with him the materially molded mind and senses.</div>

<div class="First">In the upper status of the planetary systems there are facilities thousands and thousands of times greater for material enjoyments than in the lower planetary systems. The topmost planetary systems consist of planets like Brahmaloka and Dhruvaloka (the polestar), and all of them are situated beyond Maharloka. The inhabitants of those planets are empowered with eightfold achievements of mystic perfection. They do not have to learn and practice the mystic processes of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> perfection and achieve the power of becoming small like a particle (<span class="Italic"><a href="/d/anima" class="d">a&#7751;im&#257;</a>-<a href="/d/siddhi" class="d">siddhi</a></span>), or lighter than a soft feather (<span class="Italic">laghim&#257;-<a href="/d/siddhi" class="d">siddhi</a></span>). They do not have to get anything and everything from anywhere and everywhere (<span class="Italic"><a href="/d/prapti" class="d">pr&#257;pti</a>-<a href="/d/siddhi" class="d">siddhi</a></span>), to become heavier than the heaviest (<span class="Italic"><a href="/d/mahima" class="d">mahim&#257;</a>-<a href="/d/siddhi" class="d">siddhi</a></span>), to act freely even to create something wonderful or to annihilate anything at will (<span class="Italic">&#299;&#347;itva-<a href="/d/siddhi" class="d">siddhi</a></span>), to control all material elements (<span class="Italic">va&#347;itva-<a href="/d/siddhi" class="d">siddhi</a></span>), to possess such power as will never be frustrated in any desire (<span class="Italic">pr&#257;k&#257;mya-<a href="/d/siddhi" class="d">siddhi</a></span>), or to assume any shape or form one may even whimsically desire (<span class="Italic">k&#257;m&#257;vas&#257;yit&#257;-<a href="/d/siddhi" class="d">siddhi</a></span>). All these expediencies are as common as natural gifts for the inhabitants of those higher planets. They do not require any mechanical help to travel in outer space, and they can move and travel at will from one planet to any other planet within no time. The inhabitants of the earth cannot move even to the nearest planet except by mechanical vehicles like spacecraft, but the highly talented inhabitants of such higher planets can do everything very easily.</div>
<A NAME="23484"></A><div id="23484"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Since a materialist is generally inquisitive to experience what is actually in such planetary systems, he wants to see everything personally. As inquisitive persons tour all over the world to gain direct local experience, the less intelligent transcendentalist similarly desires to have some experience of those planets about which he has heard so many wonderful things. The <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yogi" class="d">yog&#299;</a></span> can, however, easily fulfill his desire by going there with the present materialistic mind and senses. The prime inclination of the materialistic mind is to lord it over the material world, and all the <span class="Italic">siddhis</span> mentioned above are features of domination over the world. The devotees of the Lord are not ambitious to dominate a false and temporary phenomenon. On the contrary, a devotee wants to be dominated by the supreme predominator, the Lord. A desire to serve the Lord, the supreme predominator, is spiritual or transcendental, and one has to attain this purification of the mind and the senses to get admission into the spiritual kingdom. With the materialistic mind one can reach the best planet in the universe, but no one can enter into the kingdom of God. Senses are called spiritually purified when they are not involved in sense gratification. Senses require engagements, and when the senses are engaged totally in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, they have no chance to become contaminated by material infections.</div>
