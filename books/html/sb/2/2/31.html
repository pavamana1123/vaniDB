<div class="Translation">Only the purified soul can attain the perfection of associating with the Personality of Godhead in complete bliss and satisfaction in his constitutional state. Whoever is able to renovate such devotional perfection is never again attracted by this material world, and he never returns.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<A NAME="23623"></A><div id="23623"> </div>
<div class="First">We should specially note in this verse the description of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/gatim" class="d">gati&#7745;</a> <a href="/d/bhagavatim" class="d">bh&#257;gavat&#299;m</a>.</span> To become merged in the rays of the Parabrahman, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as desired by the <span class="Italic">brahmav&#257;d&#299;</span> impersonalist, is not <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhagavatim" class="d">bh&#257;gavat&#299;m</a></span> perfection. The <span class="Italic">bh&#257;gavatas</span> never accept merging in the impersonal rays of the Lord, but always aspire after personal association with the Supreme Lord in one of the <a href="/d/vaikuntha" class="d">Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha</a> spiritual planets in the spiritual sky. The whole of the spiritual sky, of which the total number of the material skies is only an insignificant part, is full of unlimited numbers of <a href="/d/vaikuntha" class="d">Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha</a> planets. The destination of the devotee (the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhagavata" class="d">bh&#257;gavata</a></span>) is to enter into one of the <a href="/d/vaikuntha" class="d">Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha</a> planets, in each of which the Personality of Godhead, in His unlimited personal expansions, enjoys Himself in the association of unlimited numbers of pure devotee associates. The conditioned souls in the material world, after gaining emancipation by devotional service, are promoted to these planets. But the number of ever-liberated souls is far, far greater than the number of conditioned souls in the material world, and the ever-liberated souls in the <a href="/d/vaikuntha" class="d">Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha</a> planets never care to visit this miserable material world.</div>
<A NAME="23624"></A><div id="23624"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The impersonalists, who aspire to merge in the impersonal <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti</span> effulgence of the Supreme Lord but have no conception of loving devotional service to Him in His personal form in the spiritual manifestation, may be compared to certain species of fish, who, being born in the rivers and rivulets, migrate to the great ocean. They cannot stay in the ocean indefinitely, for their urge for sense gratification brings them back to the rivers and streams to spawn. Similarly, when the materialist becomes frustrated in his attempts to enjoy himself in the limited material world, he may seek impersonal liberation by merging either with the Causal Ocean or with the impersonal <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti</span> effulgence. However, as neither the Causal Ocean nor the impersonal <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti</span> effulgence affords any superior substitute for association and engagement of the senses, the impersonalist will fall again into the limited material world to become entangled once more in the wheel of births and deaths, drawn on by the inextinguishable desire for sensual engagement. But any devotee who enters the kingdom of God by transcendental engagement of his senses in devotional service, and who associates with the liberated souls and the Personality of Godhead there, will never be attracted to the limited surroundings of the material world.</div>
<A NAME="23625"></A><div id="23625"> </div>
<div class="Purport">In the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span></B> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/8/15?d=1">8.15</a>) also the same is confirmed, as the Lord says, "The great <span class="Italic">mah&#257;tm&#257;s,</span> or the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">bhakti</a>-yog&#299;s,</span> after attaining My association, never come back to this material world, which is full of miseries and is nonpermanent." The highest perfection of life, therefore, is to attain His association, and nothing else. The <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">bhakti</a>-<a href="/d/yogi" class="d">yog&#299;</a>,</span> being completely engaged in the Lord's service, has no attraction for any other process of liberation like <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/jnana" class="d">j&ntilde;&#257;na</a></span> or <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a>.</span> A pure devotee is a one hundred percent devotee of the Lord and nothing more.</div>
<A NAME="23626"></A><div id="23626"> </div>
<div class="Purport">We should further note in this verse the two words <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/santam" class="d">&#347;&#257;ntam</a></span> and <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/anandam" class="d">&#257;nandam</a>,</span> which denote that devotional service of the Lord can really bestow upon the devotee two important benedictions, namely peace and satisfaction. The impersonalist is desirous of becoming one with the Supreme, or in other words, he wants to become the Supreme. This is a myth only. The mystic <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> become encumbered by various mystic powers and so have neither peace nor satisfaction. So neither the impersonalists nor the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yogi" class="d">yogi</a></span> can have real peace and satisfaction, but the devotee can become fully peaceful and satisfied because of his association with the complete whole. Therefore, merging in the Absolute or attaining some mystic powers has no attraction for the devotee.</div>
<A NAME="23627"></A><div id="23627"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Attainment of love of Godhead means complete freedom from all other attractions. The conditioned soul has many aspirations such as becoming a religious man, a rich man, or a first-class enjoyer or becoming God himself, or becoming powerful like the mystics and acting wonderfully by getting anything or doing anything, but all these aspirations should be rejected by the prospective devotee who actually wants to revive his dormant love of God. The impure devotee aspires after all of the abovementioned material things by perfection of devotion. But a pure devotee has none of the tinges of the above contaminations, which are the influence of material desires, impersonal speculations and attainment of mystic powers. One can attain the stage of love of God by pure devotional service, or by "a learned labor of love," for the sake of the devotee's lovable object, the Personality of Godhead.</div>
<A NAME="23628"></A><div id="23628"> </div>
<div class="Purport">To be more clear, if one wants to attain the stage of love of Godhead, he must give up all desires for material enjoyment, he should refrain from worshiping any of the demigods, and he should devote himself only to the worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He must give up the foolish idea of becoming one with the Lord and the desire to have some wonderful powers just to get the ephemeral adoration of the world. The pure devotee is only favorably engaged in the service of the Lord, without any hope of emolument. This will bring about love of Godhead, or the stage of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/santam" class="d">&#347;&#257;ntam</a></span> and <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/anandam" class="d">&#257;nandam</a>,</span> as stated in this verse.</div>
