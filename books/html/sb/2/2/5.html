Do the rivers, being dried up, no longer supply water to the thirsty? Are the caves of the mountains now closed, or, above all, does the Almighty Lord not protect the fully surrendered souls?

<div class="First">The renounced order of life is never meant for begging or living at the cost of others as a <a href="/d/parasite" class="d">parasite</a>. According to the dictionary, a <a href="/d/parasite" class="d">parasite</a> is a sycophant who lives at the cost of society without making any contribution to that society. The renounced order is meant for contributing something substantial to society and not depending on the earnings of the householders. On the contrary, acceptance of alms from the householders by the bona fide mendicant is an opportunity afforded by the saint for the tangible benefit of the donor. In the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sanatana" class="d">san&#257;tana</a>-<a href="/d/dharma" class="d">dharma</a></span> institution, alms-giving to the mendicant is part of a householder's duty, and it is advised in the scriptures that the householders should treat the mendicants as their family children and should provide them with food, clothing, etc., without being asked. Pseudo-mendicants, therefore, should not take advantage of the charitable disposition of the faithful householders. The first duty of a person in the renounced order of life is to contribute some literary work for the benefit of the human being in order to give him realized direction toward self-realization. Amongst the other duties in the renounced order of life of &#346;r&#299;la <a href="/d/sanatana" class="d">San&#257;tana</a>, &#346;r&#299;la <a href="/d/rupa" class="d">R&#363;pa</a> and the other Gosv&#257;m&#299;s of <a href="/d/vrndavana" class="d">V&#7771;nd&#257;vana</a>, the foremost duty discharged by them was to hold learned discourses amongst themselves at Sev&#257;ku&ntilde;ja, <a href="/d/vrndavana" class="d">V&#7771;nd&#257;vana</a> (the spot where &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/radha" class="d">R&#257;dh&#257;</a>-<a href="/d/damodara" class="d">D&#257;modara</a> Temple was established by &#346;r&#299;la <a href="/d/jiva" class="d">J&#299;va</a> Gosv&#257;m&#299; and where the actual <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/samadhi" class="d">sam&#257;dhi</a></span> tombs of &#346;r&#299;la <a href="/d/rupa" class="d">R&#363;pa</a> Gosv&#257;m&#299; and &#346;r&#299;la <a href="/d/jiva" class="d">J&#299;va</a> Gosv&#257;m&#299; are laid). For the benefit of all in human society, they left behind them immense literatures of transcendental importance. Similarly, all the <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas</span> who voluntarily accepted the renounced order of life aimed at benefiting human society and not at living a comfortable or irresponsible life at the cost of others. However, those who cannot give any contribution should not go to the householders for food, for such mendicants asking bread from the householders are an insult to the highest order. &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; gave this warning especially for those mendicants who adopt this line of profession to solve their economic problems. Such mendicants are in abundance in the age of <a href="/d/kali" class="d">Kali</a>. When a man becomes a mendicant willfully or by circumstances, he must be of firm faith and conviction that the Supreme Lord is the maintainer of all living beings everywhere in the universe. Why, then, would He neglect the maintenance of a surrendered soul who is cent percent engaged in the service of the Lord? A common master looks to the necessities of his servant, so how much more would the all-powerful, all-opulent Supreme Lord look after the necessities of life for a fully surrendered soul. The general rule is that a mendicant devotee will accept a simple small loincloth without asking anyone to give it in charity. He simply salvages it from the rejected torn cloth thrown in the street. When he is hungry he may go to a magnanimous tree which drops fruits, and when he is thirsty he may drink water from the flowing river. He does not require to live in a comfortable house, but should find a cave in the hills and not be afraid of jungle animals, keeping faith in God, who lives in everyone's heart. The Lord may dictate to tigers and other jungle animals not to disturb His devotee. <a href="/d/haridasa" class="d">Harid&#257;sa</a> &#7788;h&#257;kura, a great devotee of Lord &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/caitanya" class="d">Caitanya</a>, used to live in such a cave, and by chance a great venomous snake was a co-partner of the cave. Some admirer of &#7788;h&#257;kura <a href="/d/haridasa" class="d">Harid&#257;sa</a> who had to visit the &#7788;h&#257;kura every day feared the snake and suggested that the &#7788;h&#257;kura leave that place. Because his devotees were afraid of the snake and they were regularly visiting the cave, &#7788;h&#257;kura <a href="/d/haridasa" class="d">Harid&#257;sa</a> agreed to the proposal on their account. But as soon as this was settled, the snake actually crawled out of its hole in the cave and left the cave for good before everyone present. By the dictation of the Lord, who lived also within the heart of the snake, the snake gave preference to <a href="/d/haridasa" class="d">Harid&#257;sa</a> and decided to leave the place and not disturb him. So this is a tangible example of how the Lord gives protection to a bona fide devotee like &#7788;h&#257;kura <a href="/d/haridasa" class="d">Harid&#257;sa</a>. According to the regulations of the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sanatana" class="d">san&#257;tana</a>-<a href="/d/dharma" class="d">dharma</a></span> institution, one is trained from the beginning to depend fully on the protection of the Lord in all circumstances. The path of renunciation is recommended for acceptance by one who is fully accomplished and fully purified in his existence. This stage is described also in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span></B> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/16/5?d=1">16.5</a>) as <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/daivi" class="d">daiv&#299;</a> <a href="/d/sampat" class="d">sampat</a>.</span> A human being is required to accumulate <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/daivi" class="d">daiv&#299;</a> <a href="/d/sampat" class="d">sampat</a>,</span> or spiritual assets; otherwise, the next alternative, <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/asuri" class="d">&#257;sur&#299;</a> <a href="/d/sampat" class="d">sampat</a>,</span> or material assets, will overcome him disproportionately, and thus one will be forced into the entanglement of different miseries of the material world. A <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sannyasi" class="d">sanny&#257;s&#299;</a></span> should always live alone, without company, and he must be fearless. He should never be afraid of living alone, although he is never alone. The Lord is residing in everyone's heart, and unless one is purified by the prescribed process, one will feel that he is alone. But a man in the renounced order of life must be purified by the process; thus he will feel the presence of the Lord everywhere and will have nothing to fear (such as being without any company). Everyone can become a fearless and honest person if his very existence is purified by discharging the prescribed duty for each and every order of life. One can become fixed in one's prescribed duty by faithful aural reception of Vedic instructions and assimilation of the essence of Vedic knowledge by devotional service to the Lord.</div>
