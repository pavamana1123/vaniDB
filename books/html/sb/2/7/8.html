<div class="Translation">Being insulted by sharp words spoken by the co-wife of the king, even in his presence, Prince <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a>, though only a boy, took to severe penances in the forest. And the Lord, being satisfied by his prayer, awarded him the <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> planet, which is worshiped by great sages, both upward and downward.</div>

<div class="First">When he was only five years old, Prince <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a>, a great devotee and the son of <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> Utt&#257;nap&#257;da, was sitting on the lap of his father. His stepmother did not like the King's patting her stepson, so she dragged him out, saying that he could not claim to sit on the lap of the King because he was not born out of her womb. The little boy felt insulted by this act of his stepmother. Nor did his father make any protest, for he was too attached to his second wife. After this incident, Prince <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> went to his own mother and complained. His real mother also could not take any step against this insulting behavior, and so she wept. The boy inquired from his mother how he could sit on the royal throne of his father, and the poor queen replied that only the Lord could help him. The boy inquired where the Lord could be seen, and the queen replied that it is said that the Lord is sometimes seen by great sages in the dense forest. The child prince decided to go into the forest to perform severe penances in order to achieve his objective.</div>
<A NAME="25836"></A><div id="25836"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Prince <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> performed a stringent type of penance under the instruction of his spiritual master, &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> <a href="/d/muni" class="d">Muni</a>, who was specifically deputed for this purpose by the Personality of Godhead. Prince <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> was initiated by <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> into chanting the hymn composed of eighteen letters, namely <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/om" class="d">o&#7745;</a> <a href="/d/namo" class="d">namo</a> <a href="/d/bhagavate" class="d">bhagavate</a> <a href="/d/vasudevaya" class="d">v&#257;sudev&#257;ya</a>,</span> and Lord <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">V&#257;sudeva</a> incarnated Himself as P&#7771;&#347;nigarbha, the Personality of Godhead with four hands, and awarded the prince a specific planet above the seven stars. Prince <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a>, after achieving success in his undertakings, saw the Lord face to face, and he was satisfied that all his needs were fulfilled.</div>
<A NAME="25837"></A><div id="25837"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The planet awarded to Prince <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> is a fixed <a href="/d/vaikuntha" class="d">Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha</a> planet, installed in the material atmosphere by the will of the Supreme Lord, <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">V&#257;sudeva</a>. This planet, although within the material world, will not be annihilated at the time of devastation, but will remain fixed in its place. And because it is a <a href="/d/vaikuntha" class="d">Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha</a> planet never to be annihilated, it is worshiped even by the denizens of the seven stars situated below the <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> planet, as well as by the planets which are even above the <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> planet. <a href="/d/maharsi" class="d">Mahar&#7779;i</a> Bh&#7771;gu's planet is situated above the <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> planet.</div>
<A NAME="25838"></A><div id="25838"> </div>
<div class="Purport">So the Lord incarnated Himself as P&#7771;&#347;nigarbha just to satisfy a pure devotee of the Lord. And Prince <a href="/d/dhruva" class="d">Dhruva</a> achieved this perfection simply by chanting the hymn mentioned above, after being initiated by another pure devotee, <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a>. A serious personality can thus achieve the highest perfection of meeting the Lord and attain his objective simply by being guided by a pure devotee, who automatically approaches by dint of one's serious determination to meet the Lord by all means.</div>
<A NAME="25839"></A><div id="25839"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The description of Prince Dhruva's activities can be read in detail in the Fourth Canto of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a>.</span></div>
