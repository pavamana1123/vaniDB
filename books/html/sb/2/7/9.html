<div class="Translation"><a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/vena" class="d">Vena</a> went astray from the path of righteousness, and the br&#257;hma&#7751;as chastised him by the thunderbolt curse. By this King <a href="/d/vena" class="d">Vena</a> was burnt with his good deeds and opulence and was en route to hell. The Lord, by His causeless mercy, descended as his son, by the name of <a href="/d/prthu" class="d">P&#7771;thu</a>, delivered the condemned King <a href="/d/vena" class="d">Vena</a> from hell, and exploited the earth by drawing all kinds of crops as produce.</div>

<div class="First">According to the system of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/varnasrama" class="d">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama</a>-<a href="/d/dharma" class="d">dharma</a>,</span> the pious and learned <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> were the natural guardians of society. The <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> by their learned labor of love, would instruct the administrator-kings how to rule the country in complete righteousness, and thus the process would go on as a perfect welfare state. The kings or the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/ksatriya" class="d">k&#7779;atriya</a></span> administrators would always consult the council of learned <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as.</span> They were never autocratic monarchs. The scriptures like <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/manu" class="d">Manu</a>-<a href="/d/samhita" class="d">sa&#7745;hit&#257;</a></span> and other authorized books of the great sages were guiding principles for ruling the subjects, and there was no need for less intelligent persons to manufacture a code of law in the name of democracy. The less intelligent mass of people have very little knowledge of their own welfare, as a child has very little knowledge of its future well-being. The experienced father guides the innocent child towards the path of progress, and the childlike mass of people need similar guidance. The standard welfare codes are already there in the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/manu" class="d">Manu</a>-<a href="/d/samhita" class="d">sa&#7745;hit&#257;</a></span> and other Vedic literatures. The learned <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> would advise the king in terms of those standard books of knowledge and with reference to the particular situation of time and place. Such <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> were not paid servants of the king, and therefore they had the strength to dictate to the king on the principles of scriptures. This system continued even up to the time of <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> Candragupta, and the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a></span> C&#257;&#7751;akya was his unpaid prime minister.</div>
<A NAME="25854"></A><div id="25854"> </div>
<div class="Purport"><a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/vena" class="d">Vena</a> did not adhere to this principle of ruling, and he disobeyed the learned <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as.</span> The broad-minded <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> were not self-interested, but looked to the interest of complete welfare for all the subjects. They wanted to chastise King <a href="/d/vena" class="d">Vena</a> for his misconduct and so prayed to the Almighty Lord as well as cursed the king.</div>
<A NAME="25855"></A><div id="25855"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Long life, obedience, good reputation, righteousness, prospects of being promoted to higher planets, and blessings of great personalities are all vanquished simply by disobedience to a great soul. One should strictly try to follow in the footsteps of great souls. <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/vena" class="d">Vena</a> became a king, undoubtedly due to his past deeds of righteousness, but because he willfully neglected the great souls, he was punished by the loss of all the above-mentioned acquisitions. In the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/vamana" class="d">V&#257;mana</a> <a href="/d/purana" class="d">Pur&#257;&#7751;a</a></span> the history of <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/vena" class="d">Vena</a> and his degradation are fully described. When <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/prthu" class="d">P&#7771;thu</a> heard about the hellish condition of his father, <a href="/d/vena" class="d">Vena</a>, who was suffering from leprosy in the family of a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/mleccha" class="d">mleccha</a>,</span> he at once brought the former king to <a href="/d/kuruksetra" class="d">Kuruk&#7779;etra</a> for his purification and relieved him of all sufferings.</div>
<A NAME="25856"></A><div id="25856"> </div>
<div class="Purport"><a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/prthu" class="d">P&#7771;thu</a>, the incarnation of God, descended by the prayer of the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> to rectify the disorders on earth. He produced all kinds of crops. But, at the same time, he performed the duty of a son who delivers his father from hellish conditions. The word <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/putra" class="d">putra</a></span> means one who delivers from hell, called <span class="Italic">put.</span> That is a worthy son.</div>
