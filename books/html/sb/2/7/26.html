<div class="Translation">When the world is overburdened by the fighting strength of kings who have no faith in God, the Lord, just to diminish the distress of the world, descends with His plenary portion. The Lord comes in His original form, with beautiful black hair. And just to expand His transcendental glories, He acts extraordinarily. No one can properly estimate how great He is.</div>

<div class="First">This verse is especially describing the appearance of Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> and His immediate expansion, Lord <a href="/d/baladeva" class="d">Baladeva</a>. Both Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> and Lord <a href="/d/baladeva" class="d">Baladeva</a> are one Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord is omnipotent, and He expands Himself in innumerable forms and energies, and the whole unit is known as the one Supreme <a href="/d/brahman" class="d">Brahman</a>. Such extensions of the Lord are divided into two divisions, namely personal and differential. The personal expansions are called the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/visnu" class="d">vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a>-tattvas,</span> and the differential expansions are called the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/jiva" class="d">j&#299;va</a>-tattvas.</span> And in such expansional activity, Lord <a href="/d/baladeva" class="d">Baladeva</a> is the first personal expansion of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<A NAME="26116"></A><div id="26116"> </div>
<div class="Purport">In the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a> <a href="/d/purana" class="d">Pur&#257;&#7751;a</a>,</span> as well as in the <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata,</span> both <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> and <a href="/d/baladeva" class="d">Baladeva</a> are mentioned as having beautiful black hair, even in Their advanced age. The Lord is called <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/anupalaksya" class="d">anupalak&#7779;ya</a>-<a href="/d/margah" class="d">m&#257;rga&#7717;</a></span> or, in still more technical Vedic terms, <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/avan" class="d">av&#257;&#7749;</a>-<a href="/d/manasa" class="d">manas&#257;</a> <a href="/d/gocarah" class="d">gocara&#7717;</a>:</span> one who is never to be seen or realized by the limited sense perception of the people in general. In the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span></B> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/7/25?d=1">7.25</a>) it is said by the Lord, <span class="Italic">n&#257;ha&#7745; <a href="/d/prakasah" class="d">prak&#257;&#347;a&#7717;</a> <a href="/d/sarvasya" class="d">sarvasya</a> <a href="/d/yogamaya" class="d">yogam&#257;y&#257;</a>-<a href="/d/samavrtah" class="d">sam&#257;v&#7771;ta&#7717;</a>.</span> In other words, He reserves the right of not being exposed to anyone and everyone. Only the bona fide devotees can know Him by His specific symptoms, and out of many, many such symptoms, one symptom is mentioned here in this verse, that the Lord is <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sita" class="d">sita</a>-<a href="/d/krsna" class="d">k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>-<a href="/d/kesah" class="d">ke&#347;a&#7717;</a>,</span> or one who is observed always with beautiful black hair. Both Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> and Lord <a href="/d/baladeva" class="d">Baladeva</a> have such hair on Their heads, and thus even in advanced age They appeared like young boys sixteen years old. That is the particular symptom of the Personality of Godhead. In the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahma</a>-<a href="/d/samhita" class="d">sa&#7745;hit&#257;</a></span> it is stated that although He is the oldest personality among all living entities, He always looks like a new, youthful boy. That is the characteristic of a spiritual body. The material body is symptomized by birth, death, old age and diseases, but the spiritual body is conspicuous by the absence of those symptoms. Living entities who reside in the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;halokas in eternal life and bliss have the same type of spiritual body, without being affected by any signs of old age. It is described in the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a></span> (Canto Six) that the party of Vi&#7779;&#7751;ud&#363;tas who came to deliver <a href="/d/ajamila" class="d">Aj&#257;mila</a> from the clutches of the party of Yamar&#257;ja appeared like youthful boys, corroborating the description in this verse. It is ascertained thus that the spiritual bodies in the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;halokas, either of the Lord or of the other inhabitants, are completely distinct from the material bodies of this world. Therefore, when the Lord descends from that world to this world, He descends in His spiritual body of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/atma" class="d">&#257;tma</a>-<a href="/d/maya" class="d">m&#257;y&#257;</a>,</span> or internal potency, without any touch of the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bahiranga" class="d">bahira&#7749;g&#257;</a>-<a href="/d/maya" class="d">m&#257;y&#257;</a>,</span> or external, material energy. The allegation that the impersonal <a href="/d/brahman" class="d">Brahman</a> appears in this material world by accepting a material body is quite absurd. Therefore the Lord, when He comes here, has not a material body, but a spiritual body. The impersonal <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti</span> is only the glaring effulgence of the body of the Lord, and there is no difference in quality between the body of the Lord and the impersonal ray of the Lord, called <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti.</span></div>
<A NAME="26117"></A><div id="26117"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Now the question is why the Lord, who is omnipotent, comes here to diminish the burden created upon the world by the unscrupulous kingly order. Certainly the Lord does not need to come here personally for such purposes, but He actually descends to exhibit His transcendental activities in order to encourage His pure devotees, who want to enjoy life by chanting the glories of the Lord. In the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span></B> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/9/13?d=1">9.13</a>-14) it is stated that the <span class="Italic">mah&#257;tm&#257;s,</span> great devotees of the Lord, take pleasure in chanting of the activities of the Lord. All Vedic literatures are meant for turning one's attention towards the Lord and His transcendental activities. Thus the activities of the Lord, in His dealings with worldly people, create a subject matter for discussion by His pure devotees.</div>
