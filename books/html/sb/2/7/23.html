<div class="Translation">Due to His causeless mercy upon all living entities within the universe, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, along with His plenary extensions, appeared in the family of <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> <a href="/d/iksvaku" class="d">Ik&#7779;v&#257;ku</a> as the Lord of His internal potency, <a href="/d/sita" class="d">S&#299;t&#257;</a>. Under the order of His father, <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> Da&#347;aratha, He entered the forest and lived there for considerable years with His wife and younger brother. <a href="/d/ravana" class="d">R&#257;va&#7751;a</a>, who was very materially powerful, with ten heads on his shoulders, committed a great offense against Him and was thus ultimately vanquished.</div>

<div class="First">Lord <a href="/d/rama" class="d">R&#257;ma</a> is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and His brothers, namely <a href="/d/bharata" class="d">Bharata</a>, <a href="/d/laksmana" class="d">Lak&#7779;ma&#7751;a</a> and &#346;atrughna, are His plenary expansions. All four brothers are <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/visnu" class="d">vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a>-<a href="/d/tattva" class="d">tattva</a></span> and were never ordinary human beings. There are many unscrupulous and ignorant commentators on <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/ramayana" class="d">R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</a></span> who present the younger brothers of Lord <a href="/d/ramacandra" class="d">R&#257;macandra</a> as ordinary living entities. But here in the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a>,</span> the most authentic scripture on the science of Godhead, it is clearly stated that His brothers were His plenary expansions. Originally Lord <a href="/d/ramacandra" class="d">R&#257;macandra</a> is the incarnation of <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">V&#257;sudeva</a>, <a href="/d/laksmana" class="d">Lak&#7779;ma&#7751;a</a> is the incarnation of <a href="/d/sankarsana" class="d">Sa&#7749;kar&#7779;a&#7751;a</a>, <a href="/d/bharata" class="d">Bharata</a> is the incarnation of <a href="/d/pradyumna" class="d">Pradyumna</a>, and &#346;atrughna is the incarnation of <a href="/d/aniruddha" class="d">Aniruddha</a>, expansions of the Personality of Godhead. Lak&#7779;m&#299;j&#299; <a href="/d/sita" class="d">S&#299;t&#257;</a> is the internal potency of the Lord and is neither an ordinary woman nor the external potency incarnation of <a href="/d/durga" class="d">Durg&#257;</a>. <a href="/d/durga" class="d">Durg&#257;</a> is the external potency of the Lord, and she is associated with Lord &#346;iva.</div>
<A NAME="26070"></A><div id="26070"> </div>
<div class="Purport">As stated in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></span></B> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/4/7?d=1">4.7</a>), the Lord appears when there are discrepancies in the discharge of factual religion. Lord <a href="/d/ramacandra" class="d">R&#257;macandra</a> also appeared under the same circumstances, accompanied by His brothers, who are expansions of the Lord's internal potency, and by Lak&#7779;m&#299;j&#299; S&#299;t&#257;dev&#299;.</div>
<A NAME="26071"></A><div id="26071"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Lord <a href="/d/ramacandra" class="d">R&#257;macandra</a> was ordered by His father, <a href="/d/maharaja" class="d">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</a> Da&#347;aratha, to leave home for the forest under awkward circumstances, and the Lord, as the ideal son of His father, carried out the order, even on the occasion of His being declared the King of <a href="/d/ayodhya" class="d">Ayodhy&#257;</a>. One of His younger brothers, Lak&#7779;ma&#7751;aj&#299;, desired to go with Him, and so also His eternal wife, S&#299;t&#257;j&#299;, desired to go with Him. The Lord agreed to both of them, and all together they entered the Da&#7751;&#7693;ak&#257;ra&#7751;ya Forest, to live there for fourteen years. During their stay in the forest, there was some quarrel between <a href="/d/ramacandra" class="d">R&#257;macandra</a> and <a href="/d/ravana" class="d">R&#257;va&#7751;a</a>, and the latter kidnapped the Lord's wife, <a href="/d/sita" class="d">S&#299;t&#257;</a>. The quarrel ended in the vanquishing of the greatly powerful <a href="/d/ravana" class="d">R&#257;va&#7751;a</a>, along with all his kingdom and family.</div>
<A NAME="26072"></A><div id="26072"> </div>
<div class="Purport"><a href="/d/sita" class="d">S&#299;t&#257;</a> is Lak&#7779;m&#299;j&#299;, or the goddess of fortune, but she is never to be enjoyed by any living being. She is meant for being worshiped by the living being along with her husband, &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/ramacandra" class="d">R&#257;macandra</a>. A materialistic man like <a href="/d/ravana" class="d">R&#257;va&#7751;a</a> does not understand this great truth, but on the contrary he wants to snatch S&#299;t&#257;dev&#299; from the custody of <a href="/d/rama" class="d">R&#257;ma</a> and thus incurs great miseries. The materialists, who are after opulence and material prosperity, may take lessons from the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/ramayana" class="d">R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</a></span> that the policy of exploiting the nature of the Lord without acknowledging the supremacy of the Supreme Lord is the policy of <a href="/d/ravana" class="d">R&#257;va&#7751;a</a>. <a href="/d/ravana" class="d">R&#257;va&#7751;a</a> was very advanced materially, so much so that he turned his kingdom, <a href="/d/lanka" class="d">La&#7749;k&#257;</a>, into pure gold, or full material wealth. But because he did not recognize the supremacy of Lord <a href="/d/ramacandra" class="d">R&#257;macandra</a> and defied Him by stealing His wife, <a href="/d/sita" class="d">S&#299;t&#257;</a>, <a href="/d/ravana" class="d">R&#257;va&#7751;a</a> was killed, and all his opulence and power were destroyed.</div>
<A NAME="26073"></A><div id="26073"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Lord <a href="/d/ramacandra" class="d">R&#257;macandra</a> is a full incarnation with six opulences in full, and He is therefore mentioned in this verse as <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/kalesah" class="d">kale&#347;a&#7717;</a>,</span> or master of all opulence.</div>
