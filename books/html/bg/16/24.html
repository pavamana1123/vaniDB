<div class="Titles">PURPORT</div>
<A NAME="9315"></A><div id="9315"> </div>
<div class="Purport">As stated in the Fifteenth Chapter, all the rules and regulations of the <span class="Italic">Vedas </span>are meant for knowing <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. If one understands <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">Krs&#7751;a</a> from the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a> </span>and becomes situated in <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">Krs&#7751;a</a> consciousness, engaging himself in devotional service, he has reached the highest perfection of knowledge offered by the Vedic literature. Lord <a href="/d/caitanya" class="d">Caitanya</a> <a href="/d/mahaprabhu" class="d">Mah&#257;prabhu</a> made this process very easy: He asked people simply to chant <a href="/d/hare" class="d">Hare</a> <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, <a href="/d/hare" class="d">Hare</a> <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, <a href="/d/hare" class="d">Hare</a> Hare/ <a href="/d/hare" class="d">Hare</a> <a href="/d/rama" class="d">R&#257;ma</a>, <a href="/d/hare" class="d">Hare</a> <a href="/d/rama" class="d">R&#257;ma</a>, <a href="/d/rama" class="d">R&#257;ma</a> R&#257;ma, <a href="/d/hare" class="d">Hare</a> Hare and to engage in the devotional service of the Lord and eat the remnants of foodstuff offered to the Deity. One who is directly engaged in all these devotional activities is to be understood as having studied all Vedic literature. He has come to the conclusion perfectly. Of course, for the ordinary persons who are not in <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">Krs&#7751;a</a> consciousness or who are not engaged in devotional service, what is to be done and what is not to be done must be decided by the injunctions of the <span class="Italic">Vedas. </span>One should act accordingly, without argument. That is called following the principles of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sastra" class="d">&#347;&#257;stra</a>, </span>or scripture. <span class="Italic">&#346;&#257;stra </span>is without the four principal defects that are visible in the conditioned soul: imperfect senses, the propensity for cheating, certainty of committing mistakes, and certainty of being illusioned. These four principal defects in conditioned life disqualify one from putting forth rules and regulations. Therefore, the rules and regulations as described in the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sastra" class="d">&#347;&#257;stra</a></span>-being above these defects-are accepted without alteration by all great saints, <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas, </span>and great souls.</div>
<A NAME="9316"></A><div id="9316"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">In India there are many parties of spiritual understanding, generally classified as two: the impersonalist and the personalist. Both of them, however, lead their lives according to the principles of the <span class="Italic">Vedas. </span>Without following the principles of the scriptures, one cannot elevate himself to the perfectional stage. One who actually, therefore, understands the purport of the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras </span>is considered fortunate.</div>
<A NAME="9317"></A><div id="9317"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">In human society, aversion to the principles of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause of all falldowns. That is the greatest offense of human life. Therefore, <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/maya" class="d">m&#257;y&#257;</a></span>, the material energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is always giving us trouble in the shape of the threefold miseries. This material energy is constituted of the three modes of material nature. One has to raise himself at least to the mode of goodness before the path to understanding the Supreme Lord can be opened. Without raising oneself to the standard of the mode of goodness, one remains in ignorance and passion, which are the cause of demoniac life. Those in the modes of passion and ignorance deride the scriptures, deride the holy man, and deride the proper understanding of the spiritual master, and they do not care for the regulations of the scriptures. In spite of hearing the glories of devotional service, they are not attracted. Thus they manufacture their own way of elevation. These are some of the defects of human society, which lead to the demoniac status of life. If, however, one is able to be guided by a proper and bona fide spiritual master, who can lead one to the path of elevation, to the higher stage, then one's life becomes successful.</div>
