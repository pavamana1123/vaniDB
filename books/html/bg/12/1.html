<div class="Titles">TRANSLATION</div>

<div class="Translation"><a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> inquired: Which is considered to be more perfect: those who are properly engaged in Your devotional service, or those who worship the impersonal <a href="/d/brahman" class="d">Brahman</a>, the unmanifested?</div>
<A NAME="7527"></A><div id="7527"> </div>
<div class="Titles">PURPORT</div>
<A NAME="7528"></A><div id="7528"> </div>
<div class="Purport"><a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> has now explained about the personal, the impersonal and the universal and has described all kinds of devotees and <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span>. Generally, the transcendentalists can be divided into two classes. One is the impersonalist, and the other is the personalist. The personalist devotee engages himself with all energy in the service of the Supreme Lord. The impersonalist engages himself not directly in the service of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> but in meditation on the impersonal <a href="/d/brahman" class="d">Brahman</a>, the unmanifested.</div>
<A NAME="7529"></A><div id="7529"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">We find in this chapter that of the different processes for realization of the Absolute Truth, <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">bhakti</a>-<a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a>, </span>devotional service, is the highest. If one at all desires to have the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then he must take to devotional service.</div>
<A NAME="7530"></A><div id="7530"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Those who worship the Supreme Lord directly by devotional service are called personalists. Those who engage themselves in meditation on the impersonal <a href="/d/brahman" class="d">Brahman</a> are called impersonalists. <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> is here questioning which position is better. There are different ways to realize the Absolute Truth, but <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> indicates in this chapter that <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">bhakti</a>-<a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a>, </span>or devotional service to Him, is highest of all. It is the most direct, and it is the easiest means for association with the Godhead.</div>
<A NAME="7531"></A><div id="7531"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">In the Second Chapter the Lord explains that a living entity is not the material body but is a spiritual spark, a part of the Absolute Truth. In the Seventh Chapter He speaks of the living entity as part and parcel of the supreme whole and recommends that he transfer his attention fully to the whole. In the Eighth Chapter it is stated that whoever thinks of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> at the moment of death is at once transferred to the spiritual sky, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's abode. And at the end of the Sixth Chapter the Lord says that out of all the <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s, </span>he who thinks of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> within himself is considered to be the most perfect. So throughout the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/gita" class="d">G&#299;t&#257;</a> </span>personal devotion to <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is recommended as the highest form of spiritual realization. Yet there are those who are still attracted to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's impersonal <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti </span>effulgence, which is the all-pervasive aspect of the Absolute Truth and which is unmanifest and beyond the reach of the senses. <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> would like to know which of these two types of transcendentalists is more perfect in knowledge. In other words, he is clarifying his own position because he is attached to the personal form of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. He is not attached to the impersonal <a href="/d/brahman" class="d">Brahman</a>. He wants to know whether his position is secure. The impersonal manifestation, either in this material world or in the spiritual world of the Supreme Lord, is a problem for meditation. Actually, one cannot perfectly conceive of the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth. Therefore <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> wants to say, "What is the use of such a waste of time?" <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> experienced in the Eleventh Chapter that to be attached to the personal form of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is best because he could thus understand all other forms at the same time and there was no disturbance to his love for <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. This important question asked of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> by <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> will clarify the distinction between the impersonal and personal conceptions of the Absolute Truth.</div>
