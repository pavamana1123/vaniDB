<div class="Titles">PURPORT</div>
<A NAME="3441"></A><div id="3441"> </div>
<div class="Purport">One who is on the path of liberation by <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness is very dear to every living being, and every living being is dear to him. This is due to his <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness. Such a person cannot think of any living being as separate from <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, just as the leaves and branches of a tree are not separate from the tree. He knows very well that by pouring water on the root of the tree, the water will be distributed to all the leaves and branches, or by supplying food to the stomach, the energy is automatically distributed throughout the body. Because one who works in <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness is servant to all, he is very dear to everyone. And, because everyone is satisfied by his work, he is pure in consciousness. Because he is pure in consciousness, his mind is completely controlled. And, because his mind is controlled, his senses are also controlled. Because his mind is always fixed on <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, there is no chance of his being deviated from <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. Nor is there a chance that he will engage his senses in matters other than the service of the Lord. He does not like to hear anything except topics relating to <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>; he does not like to eat anything which is not offered to <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>; and he does not wish to go anywhere if <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is not involved. Therefore, his senses are controlled. A man of controlled senses cannot be offensive to anyone. One may ask, "Why then was <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> offensive (in battle) to others? Wasn't he in <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness?" <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> was only superficially offensive because (as has already been explained in the Second Chapter) all the assembled persons on the battlefield would continue to live individually, as the soul cannot be slain. So, spiritually, no one was killed on the Battlefield of <a href="/d/kuruksetra" class="d">Kuruk&#7779;etra</a>. Only their dresses were changed by the order of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, who was personally present. Therefore <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a>, while fighting on the Battlefield of <a href="/d/kuruksetra" class="d">Kuruk&#7779;etra</a>, was not really fighting at all; he was simply carrying out the orders of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> in full <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness. Such a person is never entangled in the reactions of work.</div>
