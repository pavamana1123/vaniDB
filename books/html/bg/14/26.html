<div class="Purport">This verse is a reply to Arjuna's third question: What is the means of attaining to the transcendental position? As explained before, the material world is acting under the spell of the modes of material nature. One should not be disturbed by the activities of the modes of nature; instead of putting his consciousness into such activities, he may transfer his consciousness to <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> activities. <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> activities are known as <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">bhakti</a>-<a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a>-</span>always acting for <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. This includes not only <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, but His different plenary expansions such as <a href="/d/rama" class="d">R&#257;ma</a> and <a href="/d/narayana" class="d">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</a>. He has innumerable expansions. One who is engaged in the service of any of the forms of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, or of His plenary expansions, is considered to be transcendentally situated. One should also note that all the forms of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> are fully transcendental, blissful, full of knowledge and eternal. Such personalities of Godhead are omnipotent and omniscient, and they possess all transcendental qualities. So, if one engages himself in the service of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> or His plenary expansions with unfailing determination, although these modes of material nature are very difficult to overcome, he can overcome them easily. This is already explained in the Seventh Chapter. One who surrenders unto <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> at once surmounts the influence of the modes of material nature. To be in <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness or in devotional service means to acquire the equality of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. The Lord says that His nature is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge, and the living entities are part and parcel of the Supreme, as gold particles are part of a gold mine. Thus the living entity's spiritual position is as good as gold, as good as <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> in quality. The difference of individuality continues, otherwise there is no question of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">bhakti</a>-<a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a>. <a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">Bhakti</a>-<a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a> </span>means that the Lord is there, the devotee is there and the activity of exchange of love between the Lord and the devotee is there. Therefore the individuality of two persons is present in the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the individual person, otherwise there is no meaning to <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">bhakti</a>-<a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a>. </span>If one is not situated in the same transcendental position with the Lord, one cannot serve the Supreme Lord. To be a personal assistant to a king, one must acquire the qualifications. Thus the qualification is to become <a href="/d/brahman" class="d">Brahman</a>, or freed from all material contamination. It is said in the Vedic literature: <span class="Italic">brahmaiva <a href="/d/san" class="d">san</a> brahm&#257;pyeti. </span>One can attain the Supreme <a href="/d/brahman" class="d">Brahman</a> by becoming <a href="/d/brahman" class="d">Brahman</a>. This means that one must qualitatively become one with <a href="/d/brahman" class="d">Brahman</a>. By attainment of <a href="/d/brahman" class="d">Brahman</a>, one does not lose his eternal <a href="/d/brahman" class="d">Brahman</a> identity as individual soul.</div>
