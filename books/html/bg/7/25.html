<div class="Translation">I am never manifest to the foolish and unintelligent. For them I am covered by My eternal creative potency [<a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a>-<a href="/d/maya" class="d">m&#257;y&#257;</a>]; and so the deluded world knows Me not, who am unborn and infallible.</div>

<div class="Titles">PURPORT</div>
<A NAME="4951"></A><div id="4951"> </div>
<div class="Purport">It may be argued that since <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> was present on this earth and was visible to everyone, then why isn't He manifest to everyone now? But actually He was not manifest to everyone. When <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> was present there were only a few people who could understand Him to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the assembly of Kurus, when &#346;i&#347;up&#257;la spoke against <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> being elected president of the assembly, <a href="/d/bhisma" class="d">Bh&#299;&#7779;ma</a> supported Him and proclaimed Him to be the Supreme God. Similarly, the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas and a few others knew that He was the Supreme, but not everyone. He was not revealed to the nondevotees and the common man. Therefore in the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/gita" class="d">G&#299;t&#257;</a></span> <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> says that but for His pure devotees, all men consider Him to be like themselves. He was manifest only to His devotees as the reservoir of all pleasure. But to others, to unintelligent nondevotees, He was covered by His eternal potency.</div>
<A NAME="4952"></A><div id="4952"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">In the prayers of <a href="/d/kunti" class="d">Kunt&#299;</a> in the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a></span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/1/8/18?d=1">1.8.18</a>), it is said that the Lord is covered by the curtain of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a>-<a href="/d/maya" class="d">m&#257;y&#257;</a></span> and thus ordinary people cannot understand Him. <a href="/d/kunti" class="d">Kunt&#299;</a> prays: "O my Lord, You are the maintainer of the entire universe, and devotional service to You is the highest religious principle. Therefore, I pray that You will also maintain me. Your transcendental form is covered by the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a>-<a href="/d/maya" class="d">m&#257;y&#257;</a></span>. The <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti</span> is the covering of the internal potency. May You kindly remove this glowing effulgence that impedes my seeing Your <span class="Italic">sac-cid-<a href="/d/ananda" class="d">&#257;nanda</a>-<a href="/d/vigraha" class="d">vigraha</a></span>, Your eternal form of bliss and knowledge."</div>
<A NAME="4953"></A><div id="4953"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">This <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a>-<a href="/d/maya" class="d">m&#257;y&#257;</a></span> curtain is also mentioned in the Fifteenth Chapter of the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/gita" class="d">G&#299;t&#257;</a></span>. The Supreme Personality of Godhead in His transcendental form of bliss and knowledge is covered by the eternal potency of <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti</span> and the less intelligent impersonalists cannot see the Supreme on this account. Also in the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a></span> (10.14.7) there is this prayer by <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a>: "O Supreme Personality of Godhead, O Supersoul, O master of all mystery, who can calculate Your potency and pastimes in this world? You are always expanding Your eternal potency, and therefore no one can understand You. Learned scientists and learned scholars can examine the atomic constitution of the material world or even the planets, but still they are unable to calculate Your energy and potency, although You are present before them." The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, is not only unborn, but He is <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/avyaya" class="d">avyaya</a></span>, inexhaustible. His eternal form is bliss and knowledge, and His energies are all inexhaustible.</div>
