<div class="Translation">Those miscreants who are grossly foolish, lowest among mankind, whose knowledge is stolen by illusion, and who partake of the atheistic nature of demons, do not surrender unto Me.</div>
<A NAME="4767"></A><div id="4767"> </div>
<div class="Titles">PURPORT</div>
<A NAME="4768"></A><div id="4768"> </div>
<div class="Purport">It is said in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a> </span>that simply by surrendering oneself unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, one can surmount the stringent laws of material nature. At this point a question arises: How is it that educated philosophers, scientists, businessmen, administrators and all the leaders of ordinary men do not surrender to the lotus feet of &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, the all-powerful Personality of Godhead? <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/mukti" class="d">Mukti</a>, </span>or liberation from the laws of material nature, is sought by the leaders of mankind in different ways and with great plans and perseverance for a great many years and births. But if that liberation is possible by simply surrendering unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then why don't these intelligent and hard-working leaders adopt this simple method?</div>
<A NAME="4769"></A><div id="4769"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/gita" class="d">G&#299;t&#257;</a> </span>answers this question very frankly. Those really learned leaders of society like <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a>, &#346;iva, <a href="/d/kapila" class="d">Kapila</a>, the Kum&#257;ras, <a href="/d/manu" class="d">Manu</a>, <a href="/d/vyasa" class="d">Vy&#257;sa</a>, <a href="/d/devala" class="d">Devala</a>, <a href="/d/asita" class="d">Asita</a>, <a href="/d/janaka" class="d">Janaka</a>, <a href="/d/prahlada" class="d">Prahl&#257;da</a>, <a href="/d/bali" class="d">Bali</a>, and later on Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya, R&#257;m&#257;nuj&#257;c&#257;rya, &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/caitanya" class="d">Caitanya</a> and many others&mdash;who are faithful philosophers, politicians, educators, scientists, etc.&mdash;surrender to the lotus feet of the Supreme Person, the all-powerful authority. Those who are not actually philosophers, scientists, educators, administrators, etc., but who <a href="/d/pose" class="d">pose</a> themselves as such for material gain, do not accept the plan or path of the Supreme Lord. They have no idea of God; they simply manufacture their own worldly plans and consequently complicate the problems of material existence in their vain attempts to solve them. Because material energy (nature) is so powerful, it can resist the unauthorized plans of the atheists and baffle the knowledge of "planning commissions."</div>
	<A NAME="4770"></A><div id="4770"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The atheistic plan-makers are described herein by the word <span class="Italic">du&#7779;k&#7771;tina, </span>or "miscreants." <span class="Italic">K&#7771;tina </span>means one who has performed meritorious work. The atheist planmaker is sometimes very intelligent and meritorious also, because any gigantic plan, good or bad, must take intelligence to execute. But because the atheist's brain is improperly utilized in opposing the plan of the Supreme Lord, the atheistic planmaker is called <span class="Italic">du&#7779;k&#7771;tina, </span>which indicates that his intelligence and efforts are misdirected.</div>
<A NAME="4771"></A><div id="4771"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">In the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/gita" class="d">G&#299;t&#257;</a> </span>it is clearly mentioned that material energy works fully under the direction of the Supreme Lord. It has no independant authority. It works as the shadow moves, in accordance with the movements of the object. But still material energy is very powerful, and the atheist, due to his godless temperament, cannot know how it works; nor can he know the plan of the Supreme Lord. Under illusion and the modes of passion and ignorance, all his plans are baffled, as in the case of Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu and <a href="/d/ravana" class="d">R&#257;va&#7751;a</a>, whose plans were smashed to dust although they were both materially learned as scientists, philosophers, administrators and educators. These <span class="Italic">du&#7779;k&#7771;tinas, </span>or miscreants, are of four different patterns, as outlined below:</div>
<A NAME="4772"></A><div id="4772"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">(1) The <span class="Italic">m&#363;&#7693;has </span>are those who are grossly foolish, like hard-working beasts of burden. They want to enjoy the fruits of their labor by themselves, and so do not want to part with them for the Supreme. The typical example of the beast of burden is the ass. This humble beast is made to work very hard by his master. The ass does not really know for whom he works so hard day and night. He remains satisfied by filling his stomach with a bundle of grass, sleeping for a while under fear of being beaten by his master, and satisfying his sex appetite at the risk of being repeatedly kicked by the opposite party. The ass sings poetry and philosophy sometimes, but this braying only disturbs others. This is the position of the foolish fruitive worker who does not know for whom he should work. He does not know that <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/karma" class="d">karma</a> </span>(action) is meant for <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yajna" class="d">yaj&ntilde;a</a> </span>(sacrifice).</div>
<A NAME="4773"></A><div id="4773"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Most often, those who work very hard day and night to clear the burden of self-created duties say that they have no time to hear of the immortality of the living being. To such <span class="Italic">m&#363;&#7693;has, </span>material gains, which are destructible, are life's all in all&mdash;despite the fact that the <span class="Italic">m&#363;&#7693;has </span>enjoy only a very small fraction of the fruit of labor. Sometimes they spend sleepless days and nights for fruitive gain, and although they may have ulcers or indigestion, they are satisfied with practically no food; they are simply absorbed in working hard day and night for the benefit of illusory masters. Ignorant of their real master, the foolish workers waste their valuable time serving mammon. Unfortunately, they never surrender to the supreme master of all masters, nor do they take time to hear of Him from the proper sources. The swine who eat the soil do not care to accept sweetmeats made of sugar<B> </B>and ghee. Similarly, the foolish worker will untiringly continue to hear of the sense-enjoyable tidings of the flickering mundane force that moves the material world.</div>
	<A NAME="4774"></A><div id="4774"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">(2) Another class of <span class="Italic">du&#7779;k&#7771;tina, </span>or miscreant, is called the <span class="Italic">nar&#257;dhama, </span>or the lowest of mankind. <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/nara" class="d">Nara</a> </span>means human being, and <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/adhama" class="d">adhama</a> </span>means the lowest. Out of the 8,400,000 different species of living beings, there are 400,000 human species. Out of these there are numerous lower forms of human life that are mostly uncivilized. The civilized human beings are those who have regulated principles of social, political and religious life. Those who are socially and politically developed, but who have no religious principles, must be considered <span class="Italic">nar&#257;dhamas. </span>Nor is religion without God religion, because the purpose of following religious principles is to know the Supreme Truth and man's relation with Him. In the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/gita" class="d">G&#299;t&#257;</a></span> the Personality of Godhead clearly states that there is no authority above Him and that He is the Supreme Truth. The civilized form of human life is meant for man's <span class="Italic">reviving the lost consciousness </span>of his eternal relation with the Supreme Truth, the Personality of Godhead &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, who is all-powerful. Whoever loses this chance is classified as a <span class="Italic">nar&#257;dhama. </span>We get information from revealed scriptures that when the baby is in the mother's womb (an extremely uncomfortable situation) he prays to God for deliverance and promises to worship Him alone as soon as he gets out. To pray to God when he is in difficulty is a natural instinct in every living being because he is eternally related with God. But after his deliverance, the child forgets the difficulties of birth and forgets his deliverer also, being influenced by <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/maya" class="d">m&#257;y&#257;</a></span>, the illusory energy.</div>
<A NAME="4775"></A><div id="4775"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">It is the duty of the guardians of children to revive the divine consciousness dormant in them. The ten processes of reformatory ceremonies, as enjoined in the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/manu" class="d">Manu</a>-<a href="/d/smrti" class="d">sm&#7771;ti</a>, </span>which is the guide to religious principles, are meant for reviving God consciousness in the system of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/varnasrama" class="d">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama</a>. </span>However, no process is strictly followed now in any part of the world, and therefore 99.9 percent of the population is <span class="Italic">nar&#257;dhama.</span></div>
<A NAME="4776"></A><div id="4776"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">When the whole population becomes <span class="Italic">nar&#257;dhama, </span>naturally all their so-called education is made null and void by the all-powerful energy of physical nature. According to the standard of the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/gita" class="d">G&#299;t&#257;</a>, </span>a learned man is he who sees on equal terms the learned <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a>, </span>the dog, the cow, the elephant and the dog-eater. That is the vision of a true devotee. &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/nityananda" class="d">Nity&#257;nanda</a> <a href="/d/prabhu" class="d">Prabhu</a>, who is the incarnation of Godhead as divine master, delivered the typical <span class="Italic">nar&#257;dhamas, </span>the brothers <a href="/d/jagai" class="d">Jagai</a> and <a href="/d/madhai" class="d">Madhai</a>, and showed how the mercy of a real devotee is bestowed upon the lowest of mankind. So the <span class="Italic">nar&#257;dhama </span>who is condemned by the Personality of Godhead can again revive his spiritual consciousness only by the mercy of a devotee.</div>
<A NAME="4777"></A><div id="4777"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">&#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/caitanya" class="d">Caitanya</a> <a href="/d/mahaprabhu" class="d">Mah&#257;prabhu</a>, in propagating the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhagavata" class="d">bh&#257;gavata</a>-<a href="/d/dharma" class="d">dharma</a> </span>or activities of the devotees, has recommended that people submissively hear the message of the Personality of Godhead. The essence of this message is <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a>. </span>The lowest amongst human beings can be delivered by this submissive hearing process only, but unfortunately they even deny giving an aural reception to these messages, and what to speak of surrendering to the will of the Supreme Lord? <span class="Italic">Nar&#257;dhamas, </span>or the lowest of mankind, willfully neglect the prime duty of the human being.</div>
<A NAME="4778"></A><div id="4778"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">(3) The next class of <span class="Italic">du&#7779;k&#7771;tina</span> is called <span class="Italic">m&#257;yay&#257;pah&#7771;ta-<a href="/d/jnana" class="d">j&ntilde;&#257;na</a>, </span>or those persons whose erudite knowledge has been nullified by the influence of illusory material energy. They are mostly very learned fellows&mdash;great philosophers, poets, literati, scientists, etc.&mdash;but the illusory energy misguides them, and therefore they disobey the Supreme Lord.</div>
	<A NAME="4779"></A><div id="4779"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">There are a great number of <span class="Italic">m&#257;yay&#257;pah&#7771;ta-j&ntilde;&#257;nas </span>at the present moment, even amongst the scholars of the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/gita" class="d">G&#299;t&#257;</a></span>. In the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/gita" class="d">G&#299;t&#257;</a></span>, in plain and simple language, it is stated that &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There is none equal to or greater than Him. He is mentioned as the father of <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a>, the original father of all human beings. In fact, &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is said to be not only the father of <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> but also the father of all species of life. He is the root of the impersonal <a href="/d/brahman" class="d">Brahman</a> and <a href="/d/paramatma" class="d">Param&#257;tm&#257;</a>; the Supersoul in every entity is His plenary portion. He is the fountainhead of everything, and everyone is advised to surrender unto His lotus feet. Despite all these clear statements, the <span class="Italic">m&#257;yay&#257;pah&#7771;ta-<a href="/d/jnana" class="d">j&ntilde;&#257;na</a> </span>deride the Personality of the Supreme Lord and consider Him merely another human being. They do not know that the blessed form of human life is designed after the eternal and transcendental feature of the Supreme Lord.</div>
<A NAME="4780"></A><div id="4780"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">All the unauthorized interpretations of the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/gita" class="d">G&#299;t&#257;</a> </span>by the class of <span class="Italic">m&#257;yay&#257;pah&#7771;ta-<a href="/d/jnana" class="d">j&ntilde;&#257;na</a>, </span>outside the purview of the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/parampara" class="d">parampar&#257;</a></span> system, are so many stumbling blocks in the path of spiritual understanding. The deluded interpreters do not surrender unto the lotus feet of &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, nor do they teach others to follow this principle.</div>
<A NAME="4781"></A><div id="4781"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">(4) The last class of <span class="Italic">du&#7779;k&#7771;tina </span>is called <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/asuram" class="d">&#257;sura&#7745;</a> <a href="/d/bhavam" class="d">bh&#257;vam</a> <a href="/d/asrita" class="d">&#257;&#347;rita</a>, </span>or those of demonic principles. This class is openly atheistic. Some of them argue that the Supreme Lord can never descend upon this material world, but they are unable to give any tangible reasons as to why not. There are others who make Him subordinate to the impersonal feature, although the opposite is declared in the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/gita" class="d">G&#299;t&#257;</a>. </span>Envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the atheist will present a number of illicit incarnations manufactured in the factory of his brain. Such persons whose very principle of life is to decry the Personality of Godhead cannot surrender unto the lotus feet of &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>.</div>
<A NAME="4782"></A><div id="4782"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">&#346;r&#299; Y&#257;mun&#257;c&#257;rya Albandru of South India said, "O my Lord! You are unknowable to persons involved with atheistic principles despite Your uncommon qualities, features, and activities and despite Your personality being confirmed by all the revealed scriptures in the quality of goodness, and despite Your being acknowledged by the famous authorities renowned for their depth of knowledge in the transcendental science and situated in the godly qualities."</div>
<A NAME="4783"></A><div id="4783"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Therefore, (1) grossly foolish persons, (2) the lowest of mankind, (3) the deluded speculators, and (4) the professed atheists, as above mentioned, never surrender unto the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead in spite of all scriptural and authoritative advice.</div>
