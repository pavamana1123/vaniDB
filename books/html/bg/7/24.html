<div class="Titles">PURPORT</div>
<A NAME="4932"></A><div id="4932"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Those who are worshipers of demigods have been described as less intelligent persons, and here the impersonalists are similarly described. Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> in His personal form is here speaking before <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a>, and still, due to ignorance, impersonalists argue that the Supreme Lord ultimately has no form. Y&#257;mun&#257;c&#257;rya, a great devotee of the Lord in the disciplic succession from R&#257;m&#257;nuj&#257;c&#257;rya, has written two very appropriate verses in this connection. He says, "My dear Lord, devotees like Vy&#257;sadeva and <a href="/d/narada" class="d">N&#257;rada</a> know You to be the Personality of Godhead. By understanding different Vedic literatures, one can come to know Your characteristics, Your form and Your activities, and one can thus understand that You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But those who are in the modes of passion and ignorance, the demons, the nondevotees, cannot understand You. They are unable to understand You. However expert such nondevotees may be in discussing <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/vedanta" class="d">Ved&#257;nta</a> </span>and the <span class="Italic">Upani&#7779;ads</span> and other Vedic literatures, it is not possible for them to understand the Personality of Godhead."</div>
<A NAME="4933"></A><div id="4933"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">In the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahma</a>-<a href="/d/samhita" class="d">sa&#7745;hit&#257;</a> </span>it is stated that the Personality of Godhead cannot be understood simply by study of the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/vedanta" class="d">Ved&#257;nta</a> </span>literature. Only by the mercy of the Supreme Lord can the Personality of the Supreme be known. Therefore in this verse it is clearly stated that not only the worshipers of the demigods are less intelligent, but those nondevotees who are engaged in <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/vedanta" class="d">Ved&#257;nta</a> </span>and speculation on Vedic literature without any tinge of true <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness are also less intelligent, and for them it is not possible to understand God's personal nature. Persons who are under the impression that the Absolute Truth is impersonal are described as <span class="Italic">asuras</span>, which means one who does not know the ultimate feature of the Absolute Truth. In the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a> </span>it is stated that supreme realization begins from the impersonal <a href="/d/brahman" class="d">Brahman</a> and then rises to the localized Supersoul&mdash;but the ultimate word in the Absolute Truth is the Personality of Godhead. Modern impersonalists are still less intelligent, for they do not even follow their great predecessor, &#346;a&#7749;kar&#257;c&#257;rya, who has specifically stated that <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Impersonalists, therefore, not knowing the Supreme Truth, think <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> to be only the son of <a href="/d/devaki" class="d">Devak&#299;</a> and <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">Vasudeva</a>, or a prince, or a powerful living entity. This is also condemned in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a>: </span>"Only the fools regard Me as an ordinary person." The fact is that no one can understand <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> without rendering devotional service and without developing <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness. The <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/gita" class="d">G&#299;t&#257;</a></span> confirms this.</div>
	<A NAME="4934"></A><div id="4934"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">One cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, or His form, quality or name simply by mental speculation or by discussing Vedic literature. One must understand Him by devotional service. When one is fully engaged in <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness, beginning by chanting the <span class="Italic">mah&#257;mantra</span>&mdash;<a href="/d/hare" class="d">Hare</a> <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, <a href="/d/hare" class="d">Hare</a> <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, <a href="/d/hare" class="d">Hare</a> Hare/<a href="/d/hare" class="d">Hare</a> <a href="/d/rama" class="d">R&#257;ma</a>, <a href="/d/hare" class="d">Hare</a> <a href="/d/rama" class="d">R&#257;ma</a>, <a href="/d/rama" class="d">R&#257;ma</a> R&#257;ma, <a href="/d/hare" class="d">Hare</a> Hare&mdash;then only can one understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Nondevotee impersonalists think that <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> has a body made of this material nature and that all His activities, His form and everything, are <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/maya" class="d">m&#257;y&#257;</a></span>. These impersonalists are known as <a href="/d/mayavadi" class="d">M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;</a>. They do not know the ultimate truth.</div>
	<A NAME="4935"></A><div id="4935"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The twentieth verse clearly states: "Those who are blinded by lusty desires surrender unto the different demigods." It is accepted that besides the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there are demigods who have their<B> </B>different planets (Bg. <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/7/23?d=1">7.23</a>), and the Lord also has a planet. It is also stated that the worshipers of the demigods go to the different planets of the demigods, and those who are devotees of Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> go to the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;aloka planet. Although this is clearly stated, the foolish impersonalists still maintain that the Lord is formless and that these forms are impositions. From the study of the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/gita" class="d">G&#299;t&#257;</a></span> does it appear that the demigods and their abodes are impersonal? Clearly, neither the demigods nor <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are impersonal. They are all persons; Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He has His own planet, and the demigods have theirs.</div>
<A NAME="4936"></A><div id="4936"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Therefore the monistic contention that ultimate truth is formless and that form is imposed does not hold true. It is clearly stated here that it is not imposed. From the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/gita" class="d">G&#299;t&#257;</a> </span>we can clearly understand that the forms of the demigods and the form of the Supreme Lord are simultaneously existing and that Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is <span class="Italic">sac-cid-<a href="/d/ananda" class="d">&#257;nanda</a>, </span>eternal blissful knowledge. The <span class="Italic">Vedas </span>also confirm that the Supreme Absolute Truth is <span class="Italic">&#257;nandamaya, </span>or full of blissful pleasure, and that He is <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/abhyasat" class="d">abhy&#257;s&#257;t</a>, </span>by nature the reservoir of unlimited auspicious qualities. And in the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/gita" class="d">G&#299;t&#257;</a> </span>the Lord says that although He is <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/aja" class="d">aja</a> </span>(unborn), He still appears. These are the facts that we should understand from the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/gita" class="d">G&#299;t&#257;</a>. </span>We cannot understand how the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be impersonal; the imposition theory of the impersonalist monist is false as far as the statements of the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/gita" class="d">G&#299;t&#257;</a> </span>are concerned. It is clear herein that the Supreme Absolute Truth, Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, has both form and personality.</div>
