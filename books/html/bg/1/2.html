<div class="Translation"><a href="/d/sanjaya" class="d">Sa&ntilde;jaya</a> said: O King, after looking over the army gathered by the sons of <a href="/d/pandu" class="d">P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;u</a>, King Duryodhana went to his teacher and began to speak the following words:</div>
<A NAME="207"></A><div id="207"> </div>
<div class="Titles">PURPORT</div>
<A NAME="208"></A><div id="208"> </div>
<div class="Purport"><a href="/d/dhrtarastra" class="d">Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra</a> was blind from birth. Unfortunately, he was also bereft of spiritual vision. He knew very well that his sons were equally blind in the matter of religion, and he was sure that they could never reach an understanding with the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas, who were all pious since birth. Still he was doubtful about the influence of the place of pilgrimage, and <a href="/d/sanjaya" class="d">Sa&ntilde;jaya</a> could understand his motive in asking about the situation on the battlefield. He wanted, therefore, to encourage the despondent King, and thus he warned him that his sons were not going to make any sort of compromise under the influence of the holy place. <a href="/d/sanjaya" class="d">Sa&ntilde;jaya</a> therefore informed the King that his son, Duryodhana, after seeing the military force of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas, at once went to the commander-in-chief, Dro&#7751;&#257;c&#257;rya, to inform him of the real position. Although Duryodhana is mentioned as the king, he still had to go to the commander on account of the seriousness of the situation. He was therefore quite fit to be a politician. But Duryodhana's diplomatic veneer could not disguise the fear he felt when he saw the military arrangement of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas.</div>
