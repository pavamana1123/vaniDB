<div class="Titles">PURPORT</div>
<A NAME="5932"></A><div id="5932"> </div>
<div class="Purport">One who acts in <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness under superior direction is called <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yukta" class="d">yukta</a></span>. The technical term is <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yukta" class="d">yukta</a>-<a href="/d/vairagya" class="d">vair&#257;gya</a></span>. This is further explained by <a href="/d/rupa" class="d">R&#363;pa</a> Gosv&#257;m&#299; as follows.</div>
<A NAME="5933"></A><div id="5933"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><a href="/d/rupa" class="d">R&#363;pa</a> Gosv&#257;m&#299; says that as long as we are in this material world we have to act; we cannot cease acting. Therefore if actions are performed and the fruits are given to <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, then that is called <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yukta" class="d">yukta</a>-<a href="/d/vairagya" class="d">vair&#257;gya</a>.</span> Actually situated in renunciation, such activities clear the mirror of the mind, and as the actor gradually makes progress in spiritual realization he becomes completely surrendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore at the end he becomes liberated, and this liberation is also specified. By this liberation he does not become one with the <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti</span> but rather enters into the planet of the Supreme Lord. It is clearly mentioned here: <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/mam" class="d">m&#257;m</a> <a href="/d/upaisyasi" class="d">upai&#7779;yasi</a>,</span> "he comes to Me," back home, back to Godhead. There are five different stages of liberation, and here it is specified that the devotee who has always lived his lifetime here under the direction of the Supreme Lord, as stated, has evolved to the point where he can, after quitting this body, go back to Godhead and engage directly in the association of the Supreme Lord.</div>
<A NAME="5934"></A><div id="5934"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Anyone who has no other interest but to dedicate his life to the service of the Lord is actually a<span class="Italic"> <a href="/d/sannyasi" class="d">sanny&#257;s&#299;</a></span> Such a person always thinks of himself as an eternal servant, dependant on the supreme will of the Lord. As such, whatever he does, he does it for the benefit of the Lord. Whatever action he performs, he performs it as service to the Lord. He does not give serious attention to the fruitive activities or prescribed duties mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span>. For ordinary persons it is obligatory to execute the prescribed duties mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span>, but although a pure devotee who is completely engaged in the service of the Lord may sometimes appear to go against the prescribed Vedic duties, actually it is not so.</div>
<A NAME="5935"></A><div id="5935"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">It is said, therefore, by <a href="/d/vaisnava" class="d">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava</a> authorities that even the most intelligent person cannot understand the plans and activities of a pure devotee. The exact words are <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/vaisnavera" class="d">vai&#7779;&#7751;avera</a> <a href="/d/kriya" class="d">kriy&#257;</a> <a href="/d/mudra" class="d">mudr&#257;</a> vij&ntilde;e <a href="/d/na" class="d">n&#257;</a> <a href="/d/bujhaya" class="d">bujhay&#257;</a></span>. A person who is thus always engaged in the service of the Lord or is always thinking and planning how to serve the Lord is to be considered completely liberated at present and in the future. His going home, back to Godhead, is guaranteed. He is above all materialistic criticism, just as <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is above all criticism.</div>
