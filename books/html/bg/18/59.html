<div class="Purport"><a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> was a military man, and born of the nature of the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/ksatriya" class="d">k&#7779;atriya</a>. </span>Therefore his natural duty was to fight. But, due to false ego, he was fearing that by killing his teacher, grandfather and friends, there would be sinful reactions. Actually he was considering himself master of his actions, as if he were directing the good and bad results of such work. He forgot that the Supreme Personality of Godhead was present there, instructing him to fight. That is the forgetfulness of the conditioned soul. The Supreme Personality gives directions as to what is good and what is bad, and one simply has to act in <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness to attain the perfection of life. No one can ascertain his destiny as the Supreme Lord can; therefore the best course is to take direction from the Supreme Lord and act. No one should neglect the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead or the order of the spiritual master who is the representative of God. One should act unhesitatingly to execute the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead-that will keep him safe under all circumstances.</div>
