<div class="Translation">Every endeavor is covered by some sort of fault, just as fire is covered by smoke. Therefore one should not give up the work which is born of his nature, O son of <a href="/d/kunti" class="d">Kunt&#299;</a>, even if such work is full of fault.</div>
<A NAME="10395"></A><div id="10395"> </div>
<div class="Titles">PURPORT</div>
<A NAME="10396"></A><div id="10396"> </div>
<div class="Purport">In conditioned life, all work is contaminated by the material modes of nature. Even if one is a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a>, </span>he has to perform sacrifices in which animal killing is necessary. Similarly, a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/ksatriya" class="d">k&#7779;atriya</a>, </span>however pious he may be, has to fight enemies. He cannot avoid it. Similarly, a merchant, however pious he may be, must sometimes hide his profit to stay in business, or he may sometimes have to do business on the black market. These things are necessary; one cannot avoid them. Similarly, even though a man is a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sudra" class="d">&#347;&#363;dra</a> </span>serving a bad master, he has to carry out the order of the master, even though it should not be done. Despite these flaws, one should continue to carry out his prescribed duties, for they are born out of his own nature.</div>
<A NAME="10397"></A><div id="10397"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">A very nice example is given herein. Although fire is pure, still there is smoke. Yet smoke does not make the fire impure. Even though there is smoke in the fire, fire is still considered to be the purest of all elements. If one prefers to give up the work of a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/ksatriya" class="d">k&#7779;atriya</a> </span>and take up the occupation of a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a>, </span>he is not assured that in the occupation of a <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahmana" class="d">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</a> </span>there are no unpleasant duties. One may then conclude that in the material world no one can be completely free from the contamination of material nature. This example of fire and smoke is very appropriate in this connection. When in wintertime one takes a stone from the fire, sometimes smoke disturbs the eyes and other parts of the body, but still one must make use of the fire despite disturbing conditions. Similarly, one should not give up his natural occupation because there are some disturbing elements. Rather, one should be determined to serve the Supreme Lord by his occupational duty in <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness. That is the perfectional point. When a particular type of occupation is performed for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, all the defects in that particular occupation are purified. When the results of work are purified, when connected with devotional service, one becomes perfect in seeing the self within, and that is self-realization.</div>
