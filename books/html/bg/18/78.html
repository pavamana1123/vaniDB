<div class="Translation">Wherever there is <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, the master of all mystics, and wherever there is <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a>, the supreme archer, there will also certainly be opulence, victory, extraordinary power, and morality.

<div class="Titles">PURPORT</div>
<A NAME="10838"></A><div id="10838"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a> </span>began with an inquiry of <a href="/d/dhrtarastra" class="d">Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra</a>. He was hopeful of the victory of his sons, assisted by great warriors like <a href="/d/bhisma" class="d">Bh&#299;&#7779;ma</a>, <a href="/d/drona" class="d">Dro&#7751;a</a> and <a href="/d/karna" class="d">Kar&#7751;a</a>. He was hopeful that the victory would be on his side. But, after describing the scene in the battlefield, <a href="/d/sanjaya" class="d">Sa&ntilde;jaya</a> told the King, "You are thinking of victory, but my opinion is that where <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> and <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> are present, there will be all good fortune." He directly confirmed that <a href="/d/dhrtarastra" class="d">Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra</a> could not expect victory for his side. Victory was certain for the side of <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> because <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> was there. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's acceptance of the post of charioteer for <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> was an exhibition of another opulence. <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is full of all opulences, and renunciation is one of them. There are many instances of such renunciation, for <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is also the master of renunciation.</div>
<A NAME="10839"></A><div id="10839"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The fight was actually between Duryodhana and <a href="/d/yudhisthira" class="d">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira</a>. <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> was fighting on behalf of his elder brother, <a href="/d/yudhisthira" class="d">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira</a>. Because <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> and <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> were on the side of <a href="/d/yudhisthira" class="d">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira</a>, Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira's victory was certain. The battle was to decide who would rule the world, and <a href="/d/sanjaya" class="d">Sa&ntilde;jaya</a> predicted that the power would be transferred to <a href="/d/yudhisthira" class="d">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira</a>. It is also predicted here that <a href="/d/yudhisthira" class="d">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira</a>, after gaining victory in this battle, would flourish more and more because he was not only righteous and pious, but he was a strict moralist. He never spoke a lie during his life.</div>
<A NAME="10840"></A><div id="10840"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">There are many less intelligent persons who take <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a> </span>to be a discussion of topics between two friends in a battlefield. But such a book cannot be scripture. Some may protest that <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> incited <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> to fight, which is immoral, but the reality of the situation is clearly stated: <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a> </span>is the supreme instruction in morality. The supreme instruction of morality is stated in the Ninth Chapter, in the thirty-fourth verse: <span class="Italic">manman&#257; <a href="/d/bhava" class="d">bhava</a> <a href="/d/mad" class="d">mad</a>-<a href="/d/bhaktah" class="d">bhakta&#7717;</a>. </span>One must become a devotee of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, and the essence of all religion is to surrender unto <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, as stated, <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sarva" class="d">Sarva</a>-<a href="/d/dharman" class="d">dharm&#257;n</a>. </span>The instructions of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a> </span>constitute the supreme process of religion and of morality. All other processes may be purifying and may lead to this process, but the last instruction of the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/gita" class="d">G&#299;t&#257;</a></span> is the last word in all morality and religion: surrender unto <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. This is the verdict of the Eighteenth Chapter.</div>
<A NAME="10841"></A><div id="10841"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">From <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a> </span>we can understand that to realize oneself by philosophical speculation and by meditation is one process, but to fully surrender unto <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is the highest perfection. This is the essence of the teachings of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a>. </span>The path of regulative principles according to the orders of social life and according to the different courses of religion may be a confidential path of knowledge in as far as the rituals of religion are confidential, but one is still involved with meditation and cultivation of knowledge. Surrender unto <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> in devotional service in full <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness is the most confidential instruction and is the essence of the Eighteenth Chapter.</div>
<A NAME="10842"></A><div id="10842"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Another feature of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a> </span>is that the actual truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. Absolute Truth is realized in three features-impersonal <a href="/d/brahman" class="d">Brahman</a>, localized <a href="/d/paramatma" class="d">Param&#257;tm&#257;</a>, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. Perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth means perfect knowledge of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. If one understands <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, then all the departments of knowledge are part and parcel of that understanding. <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is transcendental, for He is always situated in His eternal internal potency. The living entities are manifested and are divided into two classes, eternally conditioned and eternally liberated. Such living entities are innumerable, and they are considered fundamental parts of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. Material energy is manifested into twenty-four divisions. The creation is effected by eternal time, and it is created and dissolved by external energy. This manifestation of the cosmic world repeatedly becomes visible and invisible.</div>
<A NAME="10843"></A><div id="10843"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a> </span>five principal subject matters have been discussed: the Supreme Personality of Godhead, material nature, the living entities, eternal time and all kinds of activities. All of these are dependant on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. All conceptions of the Absolute Truth, namely, impersonal <a href="/d/brahman" class="d">Brahman</a>, localized <a href="/d/paramatma" class="d">Param&#257;tm&#257;</a>, or any other transcendental conception, exist within the category of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although superficially the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the living entity, material nature and time appear to be different, nothing is different from the Supreme. But the Supreme is always different from everything. Lord Caitanya's philosophy is that of "inconceivably one and different." This system of philosophy constitutes perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth.</div>
<A NAME="10844"></A><div id="10844"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The living entity in his original position is pure spirit. He is just like an atomic particle of the Supreme Spirit. The conditioned living entity, however, is the marginal energy of the Lord; he tends to be in contact with both the material energy and the spiritual energy. In other words, the living entity is situated between the two energies of the Lord, and because he belongs to the superior energy of the Lord, he has a particle of independence. By proper use of that independence he comes under the direct order of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. Thus he attains his normal condition in the pleasure-giving potency.</div>
