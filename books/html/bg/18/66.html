<div class="Titles">TRANSLATION</div>
<A NAME="10650"></A><div id="10650"> </div>
<div class="Translation">Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction. Do not fear.</div>
<A NAME="10651"></A><div id="10651"> </div>
<div class="Titles">PURPORT</div>
<A NAME="10652"></A><div id="10652"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The Lord has described various kinds of knowledge, processes of religion, knowledge of the Supreme <a href="/d/brahman" class="d">Brahman</a>, knowledge of the Supersoul, knowledge of the different types of orders and statuses of social life, knowledge of the renounced order of life, knowledge of nonattachment, sense and mind control, meditation, etc. He has described in so many ways different types of religion. Now, in summarizing <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a>, </span>the Lord says that <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> should give up all the processes that have been explained to him; he should simply surrender to <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. That surrender will save him from all kinds of sinful reactions, for the Lord personally promises to protect him.</div>
<A NAME="10653"></A><div id="10653"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">In the Eighth Chapter it was said that only one who has become free from all sinful reactions can take to the worship of Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. Thus one may think that unless he is free from all sinful reactions he cannot take to the surrendering process. To such doubts it is here said that even if one is not free from all sinful reactions, simply by the process of surrendering to &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> he is automatically freed. There is no need of strenuous effort to free oneself from sinful reactions. One should unhesitatingly accept <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> as the supreme savior of all living entities. With faith and love, one should surrender unto Him.</div>
<A NAME="10654"></A><div id="10654"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">According to the devotional process, one should simply accept such religious principles that will lead ultimately to the devotional service of the Lord. One may perform a particular occupational duty according to his position in the social order, but if by executing his duty one does not come to the point of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness, all his activities are in vain.</div>
<A NAME="10655"></A><div id="10655"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Anything that does not lead to the perfectional stage of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness should be avoided. One should be confident that in all circumstances <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> will protect him from all difficulties. There is no need of thinking how one should keep the body and soul together. <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> will see to that. One should always think himself helpless and should consider <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> the only basis for his progress in life. As soon as one seriously engages himself in devotional service to the Lord in full <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness, at once he becomes freed from all contamination of material nature. There are different processes of religion and purificatory processes by cultivation of knowledge, meditation in the mystic <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a></span> system, etc., but one who surrenders unto <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> does not have to execute so many methods. That simple surrender unto <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> will save him from unnecessarily wasting time. One can thus make all progress at once and be freed from all sinful reaction.</div>
<A NAME="10656"></A><div id="10656"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">One should be attracted by the beautiful vision of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. His name is <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> because He is all-attractive. One who becomes attracted by the beautiful, all-powerful, omnipotent vision of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is fortunate. There are different kinds of transcendentalists-some of them are attached to the impersonal <a href="/d/brahman" class="d">Brahman</a> vision, some of them are attracted by the Supersoul feature, etc., but one who is attracted to the personal feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and, above all, one who is attracted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead as <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> Himself, is the most perfect transcendentalist. In other words, devotional service to <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, in full consciousness, is the most confidential part of knowledge, and this is the essence of the whole <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a>. <a href="/d/karma" class="d">Karma</a>-yog&#299;s</span>, empiric philosophers, mystics, and devotees are all called transcendentalists, but one who is a pure devotee is the best of all. The particular words used here, <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/ma" class="d">m&#257;</a> <a href="/d/sucah" class="d">&#347;uca&#7717;</a></span>, "Don't fear, don't hesitate, don't worry," are very significant. One may be perplexed as to how one can give up all kinds of religious forms and simply surrender unto <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, but such worry is useless.</div>
