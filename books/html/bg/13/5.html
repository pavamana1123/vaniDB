<div class="Translation">That knowledge of the field of activities and of the knower of activities is described by various sages in various Vedic writings-especially in the <a href="/d/vedanta" class="d">Ved&#257;nta</a>-<a href="/d/sutra" class="d">s&#363;tra</a>-and is presented with all reasoning as to cause and effect.</div>

<div class="Purport">The Supreme Personality of Godhead, <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, is the highest authority in explaining this knowledge. Still, as a matter of course, learned scholars and standard authorities always give evidence from previous authorities. <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is explaining this most controversial point regarding the duality and non-duality of the soul and the Supersoul by referring to Scriptures, the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/vedanta" class="d">Ved&#257;nta</a>, </span>which are accepted as authority. First, He says, this is according to different sages. As far as the sages are concerned, besides Himself, Vy&#257;sadeva, the author of the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/vedanta" class="d">Ved&#257;nta</a>-<a href="/d/sutra" class="d">s&#363;tra</a>, </span>is<span class="Italic"> </span>a great sage, and in the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/vedanta" class="d">Ved&#257;nta</a>-<a href="/d/sutra" class="d">s&#363;tra</a> </span>duality is perfectly explained. And Vy&#257;sadeva's father, <a href="/d/parasara" class="d">Par&#257;&#347;ara</a>, was also a great sage, and he writes in his books of religiosity: "<span class="Italic"><a href="/d/aham" class="d">aham</a> <a href="/d/tvam" class="d">tva&#7745;</a> <a href="/d/ca" class="d">ca</a> ath&#257;nye...</span>" "We-you, I and various other living entities-are all transcendental, although in material bodies. Now we are fallen into the ways of the three modes of material nature according to our different <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/karma" class="d">karma</a>.</span> As such, some are on higher levels, and some are in the lower nature. The higher and lower natures exist due to ignorance and are being manifested in an infinite number of living entities. But the Supersoul, which is infallible, is uncontaminated by the three qualities of nature and is transcendental." Similarly, in the original <span class="Italic">Vedas, </span>a distinction between the soul, the Supersoul and the body is made, especially in the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/katha" class="d">Ka&#7789;ha</a> <a href="/d/upanisad" class="d">Upani&#7779;ad</a>.</span></div>
<A NAME="7868"></A><div id="7868"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">There is a manifestation of the Supreme Lord's energy known as <span class="Italic">annamaya </span>by which one depends simply upon food for existence. This is a materialistic realization of the Supreme. Then there is <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/pranamaya" class="d">pr&#257;&#7751;amaya</a>; </span>this means that after realizing the Supreme Absolute Truth in foodstuff, one can realize the Absolute Truth in the living symptoms, or life forms. In <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;namaya </span>the living symptom develops to the point of thinking, feeling, and willing. Then there is <a href="/d/brahman" class="d">Brahman</a> realization and the realization called <span class="Italic">vij&ntilde;&#257;namaya</span> by which the living entity's mind and life symptoms are distinguished from the living entity himself. The next and supreme stage is <span class="Italic">&#257;nandamaya, </span>realization of the all-blissful nature. Thus there are five stages of <a href="/d/brahman" class="d">Brahman</a> realization, which is called <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahma" class="d">brahma</a> <a href="/d/puccham" class="d">puccham</a>. </span>Out of these the first three-<span class="Italic">annamaya, <a href="/d/pranamaya" class="d">pr&#257;&#7751;amaya</a>, </span>and <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;namaya-</span>involve the fields of activities of the living entities. Transcendental to all these fields of activities is the Supreme Lord, who is called <span class="Italic">&#257;nandamaya. </span>In the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/vedanta" class="d">Ved&#257;nta</a>-<a href="/d/sutra" class="d">s&#363;tra</a> </span>also the Supreme is called <span class="Italic">&#257;nandamayo 'bhy&#257;s&#257;t. </span>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is by nature full of joy, and to enjoy His transcendental bliss, He expands into <span class="Italic">vij&ntilde;&#257;namaya, <a href="/d/pranamaya" class="d">pr&#257;&#7751;amaya</a>, j&ntilde;&#257;namaya, </span>and <span class="Italic">annamaya. </span>In this field of activities the living entity is considered to be the enjoyer, and different from him is the <span class="Italic">&#257;nandamaya. </span>That means that if the living entity decides to enjoy, in dovetailing himself with the <span class="Italic">&#257;nandamaya, </span>then he becomes perfect. This is the real picture of the Supreme Lord, as supreme knower of the field, the living entity, as subordinate knower, and the nature of the field of activities.</div>
