<div class="Purport">Extravagance in the matter of eating, sleeping, defending and mating&mdash;which are demands of the body&mdash;can block advancement in the practice of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a>. </span>As far as eating is concerned, it can be regulated only when one is practiced to take and accept <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/prasadam" class="d">pras&#257;dam</a>, </span>sanctified food. Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is offered, according to the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a> </span>(Bg. <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/9/26?d=1">9.26</a>), vegetables, flowers, fruits, grains, milk, etc. In this way, a person in <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness becomes automatically trained not to accept food not meant for human consumption, or which is not in the category of goodness. As far as sleeping is concerned, a <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> conscious person is always alert in the discharge of his duties in <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness, and therefore any unnecessary time spent sleeping is considered a great loss. A <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> conscious person cannot bear to pass a minute of his life without being engaged in the service of the Lord. Therefore, his sleeping is kept to a minimum. His ideal in this respect is &#346;r&#299;la <a href="/d/rupa" class="d">R&#363;pa</a> Gosv&#257;m&#299;, who was always engaged in the service of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> and who could not sleep more than two hours a day, and sometimes not even that. &#7788;h&#257;kura <a href="/d/haridasa" class="d">Harid&#257;sa</a> would not even accept <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/prasadam" class="d">pras&#257;dam</a> </span>nor even sleep for a moment without finishing his daily routine of chanting with his beads three hundred thousand names. As far as work is concerned, a <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> conscious person does not do anything which is not connected with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's interest, and thus his work is always regulated and is untainted by sense gratification. Since there is no question of sense gratification, there is no material leisure for a person in <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness. And because he is regulated in all his work, speech, sleep, wakefulness and all other bodily activities, there is no material misery for him.</div>
