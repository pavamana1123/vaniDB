<A NAME="7307"></A><div id="7307"> </div>
<div class="Translation">You are the father of this complete cosmic manifestation, the worshipable chief, the spiritual master. No one is equal to You, nor can anyone be one with You. Within the three worlds, You are immeasurable.</div>
<A NAME="7308"></A><div id="7308"> </div>
<div class="Titles">PURPORT</div>
<A NAME="7309"></A><div id="7309"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is worshipable as a father is worshipable for his son. He is the spiritual master because He originally gave the Vedic instructions to <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a>, and presently He is also instructing <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a> </span>to <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a>; therefore He is the original spiritual master, and any bona fide spiritual master at the present moment must be a descendant in the line of disciplic succession stemming from <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. Without being a representative of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, one cannot become a teacher or spiritual master of transcendental subject matter.</div>
<A NAME="7310"></A><div id="7310"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The Lord is being paid obeisances in all respects. He is of immeasurable greatness. No one can be greater than the Supreme Personality of Godhead, <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, because no one is equal to or higher than <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> within any manifestation, spiritual or material. Everyone is below Him. No one can excel Him.</div>
<A NAME="7311"></A><div id="7311"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The Supreme Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> has senses and a body like the ordinary man, but for Him there is no difference between His senses, body, mind and Himself. Foolish persons who do not know Him perfectly say that <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is different from His soul, mind, heart and everything else. <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is absolute; therefore His activities and potencies are supreme. It is also stated that He does not have senses like ours. He can perform all sensual activities; therefore His senses are neither imperfect nor limited. No one can be greater than Him, no one can be equal to Him, and everyone is lower than Him.</div>
<A NAME="7312"></A><div id="7312"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Whoever knows His transcendental body, activities and perfection, after quitting his body, returns to Him and doesn't come back again to this miserable world. Therefore one should know that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's activities are different from others. The best policy is to follow the principles of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>; that will make one perfect. It is also stated that there is no one who is master of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>; everyone is His servant. Only <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is God, and everyone is servant. Everyone is complying with His order. There is no one who can deny His order. Everyone is acting according to His direction, being under His superintendence. As stated in the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a>-<a href="/d/samhita" class="d">sa&#7745;hit&#257;</a>, </span>He is the cause of all causes.</div>
