<div class="Translation">The Blessed Lord said: My dear <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a>, the form which you are now seeing is very difficult to behold. Even the demigods are ever seeking the opportunity to see this form which is so dear.</div>
<A NAME="7453"></A><div id="7453"> </div>
<div class="Titles">PURPORT</div>
<A NAME="7454"></A><div id="7454"> </div>
<div class="Purport">In the forty-eighth verse of this chapter Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> concluded revealing His universal form and informed <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> that this form is not possible to be seen by so many activities, sacrifices, etc. Now here the word <span class="Italic">sudurdar&#347;am </span>is<span class="Italic"> </span>used, indicating that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's two-handed form is still more confidential. One may be able to see the universal form of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> by adding a little tinge of devotional service to various activities like penance, Vedic study and philosophical speculation, etc. It may be possible, but without a tinge of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">bhakti</a>, </span>one cannot see; that has already been explained. Still, beyond that universal form, the form of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> as a two-handed man is still more difficult to see, even for demigods like <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> and Lord &#346;iva. They desire to see Him, and we have evidences in the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a> </span>that when He was supposed to be in the womb of His mother, <a href="/d/devaki" class="d">Devak&#299;</a>, all the demigods from heaven came to see the marvel of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. They even waited to see Him. A foolish person may deride Him, but that is an ordinary person. <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is actually desired to be seen by demigods like <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a> and &#346;iva in His two-armed form.</div>
<A NAME="7455"></A><div id="7455"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a> </span>it is also confirmed that He is not visible to the foolish persons who deride Him. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's body, as confirmed by <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a>-<a href="/d/samhita" class="d">sa&#7745;hit&#257;</a> </span>and confirmed by Himself in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a>, </span>is<span class="Italic"> </span>completely spiritual and full of bliss and eternality. His body is never like a material body. But for some who make a study of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> by reading <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a> </span>or similar Vedic scriptures, <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is a problem. For one using a material process, <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is considered to be a great historical personality and very learned philosopher. But He isn't an ordinary man. But some think that even though He was so powerful, He had to accept a material body. Ultimately they think that the Absolute Truth is impersonal; therefore they think that from His impersonal feature He assumed a personal feature attached to material nature. This is a materialistic calculation of the Supreme Lord. Another calculation is speculative. Those who are in search of knowledge also speculate on <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> and consider Him to be less important than the universal form of the Supreme. Thus some think that the universal form of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> which was manifested to <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> is more important than His personal form. According to them, the personal form of the Supreme is something imaginary. They believe that in the ultimate issue, the Absolute Truth is not a person. But the transcendental process is described in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a>, </span>Chapter Two: to hear about <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> from authorities. That is the actual Vedic process, and those who are actually in the Vedic line hear about <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> from authority, and by repeated hearing about Him, <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> becomes dear. As we have several times discussed, <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is covered by His <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a>-<a href="/d/maya" class="d">m&#257;y&#257;</a> </span>potency. He is not to be seen or revealed to anyone and everyone. Only by one to whom He reveals Himself can He be seen. This is confirmed in Vedic literature; for one who is a surrendered soul, the Absolute Truth can actually be understood. The transcendentalist, by continuous <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness and by devotional service to <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, can have his spiritual eyes opened and can see <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> by revelation. Such a revelation is not possible even for the demigods; therefore it is difficult even for the demigods to understand <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, and the advanced demigods are always in hope of seeing <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> in His two-handed form. The conclusion is that although to see the universal form of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is very, very difficult and not possible for anyone and everyone, it is still more difficult to understand His personal form as &#346;y&#257;masundara.</div>
