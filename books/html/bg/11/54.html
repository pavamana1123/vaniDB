<div class="Purport"><a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> can be understood only by the process of undivided devotional service. He explicitly explains this in this verse so unauthorized commentators, who try to understand <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a> </span>by the speculative process, will know that they are simply wasting their time. No one can understand <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> or how He came from parents in a four-handed form and at once changed Himself into a two-handed form. It is clearly stated here that no one can see Him. Those who, however, are very experienced students of Vedic literature can learn about Him from the Vedic literature in so many ways. There are so many rules and regulations, and if one at all wants to understand <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, he must follow the regulative principles described in the authoritative literature. One can perform penance in accordance with those principles. As far as charity is concerned, it is plain that charity should be given to the devotees of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> who are engaged in His devotional service to spread the <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> philosophy or <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness throughout the world. <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness is a benediction to humanity. Lord <a href="/d/caitanya" class="d">Caitanya</a> was appreciated by <a href="/d/rupa" class="d">R&#363;pa</a> Gosv&#257;m&#299; as the most munificent man of charity because love of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, which is very difficult to achieve, was distributed freely by Him. And if one worships as prescribed in the temple (in the temples in India there is always some statue, usually of <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a> or <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>), that is a chance to progress. For the beginners in devotional service to the Lord, temple worship is very essential, and this is confirmed in the Vedic literature.</div>
<A NAME="7486"></A><div id="7486"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">One who has unflinching devotion for the Supreme Lord and is directed by the spiritual master can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead by revelation. For one who does not take personal training under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master, it is impossible to even begin to understand <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. The word <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/tu" class="d">tu</a></span> is specifically used here to indicate that no other process can be used, can be recommended, or can be successful in understanding <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>.</div>
<A NAME="7487"></A><div id="7487"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The personal forms of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, the two-handed form and the four-handed, are completely different from the temporary universal form shown to <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a>. The four-handed form is <a href="/d/narayana" class="d">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</a>, and the two-handed form is <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>; they are eternal and transcendental, whereas the universal form exhibited to <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> is temporary. The very word <span class="Italic">sudurdar&#347;am, </span>meaning difficult to see, suggests that no one saw that universal form. It also suggests that amongst the devotees there was no necessity of showing it. That form was exhibited by <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> at the request of <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> because in the future, when one represents himself as an incarnation of God, people can ask to see his universal form.</div>
<A NAME="7488"></A><div id="7488"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> changes from the universal form to the four-handed form of <a href="/d/narayana" class="d">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</a> and then to His own natural form of two hands. This indicates that the four-handed forms and other forms mentioned in Vedic literature are all emanations of the original two-handed <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. He is the origin of all emanations. <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is distinct even from these forms, not to speak of the impersonal conception. As far as the four-handed forms of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> are concerned, it is stated clearly that even the most identical four-handed form of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> (which is known as <a href="/d/maha" class="d">Mah&#257;</a>-<a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a>, who is lying on the cosmic ocean and from whose breathing so many innumerable universes are passing out and entering) is also an expansion of the Supreme Lord. Therefore one should conclusively worship the personal form of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> as the Supreme Personality of Godhead who is eternity, bliss and knowledge. He is the source of all forms of <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a>, He is the source of all forms of incarnation, and He is the original Supreme Personality, as confirmed in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a>.</span></div>
<A NAME="7489"></A><div id="7489"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">In the Vedic literature it is stated that the Supreme Absolute Truth is a person. His name is <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, and He sometimes descends on this earth. Similarly, in<B> <span class="Italic"></B>&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a> </span>there is a description of all kinds of incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and there it is said that <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is not an incarnation of God but is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. <span class="Italic">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;as <a href="/d/tu" class="d">tu</a> <a href="/d/bhagavan" class="d">bhagav&#257;n</a> <a href="/d/svayam" class="d">svayam</a>. </span>Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a> </span>the Lord says, <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/mattah" class="d">matta&#7717;</a> <a href="/d/parataram" class="d">parataram</a> n&#257;ny&#257;t: </span>"There is nothing superior to My form as the Personality of Godhead <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>." He also says elsewhere in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a>, <a href="/d/aham" class="d">aham</a> &#257;dir <a href="/d/hi" class="d">hi</a> <a href="/d/devanam" class="d">dev&#257;n&#257;m</a>:</span> "I am the origin of all the demigods." And after understanding <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a> </span>from <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> also confirms this in the following words: <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/param" class="d">para&#7745;</a> <a href="/d/brahma" class="d">brahma</a> <a href="/d/param" class="d">para&#7745;</a> <a href="/d/dhama" class="d">dh&#257;ma</a> <a href="/d/pavitram" class="d">pavitra&#7745;</a> <a href="/d/paramam" class="d">parama&#7745;</a><B> </B><a href="/d/bhavan" class="d">bhav&#257;n</a>:</span> "I now fully understand that You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, and that You are the refuge of everything." Therefore the universal form which <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> showed to <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> is not the original form of God. The original is the <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> form. The universal form, with its thousands and thousands of heads and hands, is manifest just to draw the attention of those who have no love for God. It is not God's original form.</div>
<A NAME="7490"></A><div id="7490"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The universal form is not attractive for pure devotees, who are in love with the Lord in different transcendental relationships. The Supreme Godhead exchanges transcendental love in His original form of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. Therefore to <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a>, who was so intimately related with <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> in friendship, this form of the universal manifestation was not pleasing; rather, it was fearful. <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a>, who is a constant companion of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's, must have had transcendental eyes; he was not an ordinary man. Therefore he was not captivated by the universal form. This form may seem wonderful to persons who are involved in elevating themselves by fruitive activities, but to persons who are engaged in devotional service, the two-handed form of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is the most<B> </B>dear.</div>
