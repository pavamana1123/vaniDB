<div class="Translation">O greatest of all personalities, O supreme form, though I see here before me Your actual position, I yet wish to see how You have entered into this cosmic manifestation. I want to see that form of Yours.</div>

<div class="Titles">PURPORT</div>
<A NAME="6755"></A><div id="6755"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The Lord said that because He entered into the material universe by His personal representation, the cosmic manifestation has been made possible and is going on. Now as far as <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> is concerned, he is inspired by the statements of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, but in order to convince others in the future who may think that <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is an ordinary person, he desires to see Him actually in His universal form, to see how He is acting from within the universe, although He is apart from it. Arjuna's asking the Lord's permission is also significant. Since the Lord is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He is present within <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> himself; therefore He knows the desire of <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a>, and He can understand that <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> has no special desire to see Him in His universal form, for he is completely satisfied to see Him in His personal form of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. But He can understand also that <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> wants to see the universal form to convince others. He did not have any personal desire for confirmation. <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> also understands that <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> wants to see the universal form to set a criterion, for in the future there would be so many imposters who would <a href="/d/pose" class="d">pose</a> themselves as incarnations of God. The people, therefore, should be careful; one who claims to be <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> should be prepared to show his universal form to confirm his claim to the people.</div>
