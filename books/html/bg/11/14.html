<div class="Translation">Then, bewildered and astonished, his hair standing on end, <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> began to pray with folded hands, offering obeisances to the Supreme Lord.</div>

<div class="Purport">Once the divine vision is revealed, the relationship between <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> and <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> changes immediately. Before, <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> and <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> had a relationship based on friendship, but here, after the revelation, <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> is offering obeisances with great respect, and with folded hands he is praying to <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. He is praising the universal form. Thus Arjuna's relationship becomes one of wonder rather than friendship. Great devotees see <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> as the reservoir of all relationships. In the scriptures there are twelve basic kinds of relationships mentioned, and all of them are present in <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. It is said that He is the ocean of all the relationships exchanged between two living entities, between the gods, or between the Supreme Lord and His devotees.</div>
<A NAME="6912"></A><div id="6912"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">It is said that <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> was inspired by the relationship of wonder, and in that wonder, although he was by nature very sober, calm and quiet, he became ecstatic, his hair stood up, and he began to offer his obeisances unto the Supreme Lord with folded hands. He was not, of course, afraid. He was affected by the wonders of the Supreme Lord. The immediate context is wonder; his natural loving friendship was overwhelmed by wonder, and thus he reacted in this way.</div>
