<div class="Titles">PURPORT</div>
<A NAME="7505"></A><div id="7505"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Anyone who wants to approach the Supreme of all the Personalities of Godhead, on the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;aloka planet in the spiritual sky, and be intimately connected with the Supreme Personality, <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, must take this formula, as is stated by the Supreme Himself. Therefore, this verse is considered to be the essence of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a>. </span>The <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a> </span>is<span class="Italic"> </span>a book directed to the conditioned souls, who are engaged in the material world with the purpose of lording it over nature and who do not know of the real, spiritual life. The <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a> </span>is<span class="Italic"> </span>meant to show how one can understand his spiritual existence and his eternal relationship with the Supreme Spiritual Personality and to teach one how to go back home, back to Godhead. Now here is the verse which clearly explains the process by which one can attain success in his spiritual activity: devotional service. As far as work is concerned, one should transfer his energy entirely to <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> conscious activities. No work should be done by any man except in relationship to <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. This called <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>-<span class="Italic"><a href="/d/karma" class="d">karma</a></span>. One may be engaged in various activities, but one should not be attached to the result of his work, but the result should be done for Him. For example, one may be engaged in business, but to transform that activity into <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness, one has to do business for <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. If <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is the proprietor of the business, then <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> should enjoy the profit of the business. If a businessman is in possession of thousands and thousands of dollars, and if he has to offer all this to <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, he can do it. This is work for <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. Instead of constructing a big building for his sense gratification, he can construct a nice temple for <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, and he can install the Deity of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> and arrange for the Deity's service, as is outlined in the authorized books of devotional service. This is all <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>-<span class="Italic"><a href="/d/karma" class="d">karma</a></span>. One should not be attached to the result of his work, but the result should be offered to <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. One should also accept as <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/prasadam" class="d">pras&#257;dam</a>, </span>food, the remnants of offerings to <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. If, however, one is not able to construct a temple for <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, one can engage himself in cleansing the temple of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>; that is also <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>-<span class="Italic"><a href="/d/karma" class="d">karma</a></span>. One can cultivate a garden. Anyone who has land-in India, at least, any poor man has a certain amount of land-can utilize that for <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> by growing flowers to offer Him. He can sow <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/tulasi" class="d">tulas&#299;</a></span> plants because <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/tulasi" class="d">tulas&#299;</a></span> leaves are very important, and <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> has recommended this in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a>. </span><a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> desires that one offer Him either a leaf, or a flower, or a little water-and He is satisfied. This leaf especially refers to the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/tulasi" class="d">tulas&#299;</a> </span>So one can sow <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/tulasi" class="d">tulas&#299;</a> </span>leaves and pour water on the plant. Thus, even the poorest man can engage in the service of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. These are some of the examples of how one can engage in working for <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>.</div>
<A NAME="7506"></A><div id="7506"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The word <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/mat" class="d">mat</a>-<a href="/d/paramah" class="d">parama&#7717;</a> </span>refers to one who considers the association of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> in His supreme abode to be the highest perfection of life. Such a person does not wish to be elevated to the higher planets such as the moon or sun or heavenly planets, or even the highest planet of this universe, Brahmaloka. He has no attraction for that. He is only attracted to being transferred to the spiritual sky. And even in the spiritual sky he is not satisfied with merging into the glowing <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti </span>effulgence, for he wants to enter the highest spiritual planet, namely K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;aloka, <a href="/d/goloka" class="d">Goloka</a> <a href="/d/vrndavana" class="d">V&#7771;nd&#257;vana</a>. He has full knowledge of that planet, and therefore he is not interested in any other. As indicated by the word <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/mad" class="d">mad</a>-<a href="/d/bhaktah" class="d">bhakta&#7717;</a>, </span>he fully engages in devotional service, specifically in the nine processes of devotional engagement: hearing, chanting, remembering, worshiping, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, offering prayers, carrying out the orders of the Lord, making friends with Him, and surrendering everything to Him. One can engage in all nine devotional processes, or eight, or seven, or at least in one, and that will surely make one perfect.</div>
<A NAME="7507"></A><div id="7507"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The term <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/sanga" class="d">sa&#7749;ga</a>-<a href="/d/varjitah" class="d">varjita&#7717;</a></span> is very significant. One should disassociate himself from persons who are against <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. Not only are the atheistic persons against <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, but also those who are attracted to fruitive activities and mental speculation. Therefore the pure form of devotional service is described in <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">Bhakti</a>-<a href="/d/rasamrta" class="d">ras&#257;m&#7771;ta</a>-<a href="/d/sindhu" class="d">sindhu</a> </span>as follows: <span class="Italic">any&#257;bhil&#257;&#7779;it&#257;-<a href="/d/sunyam" class="d">&#347;&#363;nya&#7745;</a> <a href="/d/jnana" class="d">j&ntilde;&#257;na</a>-karm&#257;dy-<a href="/d/anavrtam" class="d">an&#257;v&#7771;tam</a> <a href="/d/anukulyena" class="d">&#257;nuk&#363;lyena</a> k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;&#257;nu&#347;&#299;lana&#7745; bhaktir <a href="/d/uttama" class="d">uttam&#257;</a>. </span>In this verse &#346;r&#299;la <a href="/d/rupa" class="d">R&#363;pa</a> Gosv&#257;m&#299; clearly states that if anyone wants to execute unalloyed devotional service, he must be freed from all kinds of material contamination. He must be freed from the association of persons who are addicted to fruitive activities and mental speculation. When, freed from such unwanted association and from the contamination of material desires, one favorably cultivates knowledge of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, that is called pure devotional service. <span class="Italic">&#256;nuk&#363;lyasya sa&#7749;kapla&#7717; <a href="/d/pratikulyasya" class="d">pr&#257;tik&#363;lyasya</a> <a href="/d/varjanam" class="d">varjanam</a></span>. One should think of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> and act for <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> favorably, not unfavorably. <a href="/d/kamsa" class="d">Ka&#7745;sa</a> was an enemy of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's. From the very beginning of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's birth, he planned in so many ways to kill Him, and because he was always unsuccessful, he was always thinking of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. Thus while working, while eating and while sleeping, he was always <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> conscious in every respect, but that <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness was not favorable, and therefore in spite of his always thinking of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> twenty-four hours a day, he was considered a demon, and <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> at last killed him. Of course anyone who is killed by <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> attains salvation immediately, but that is not the aim of the pure devotee. The pure devotee does not even want salvation. He does not want to be transferred even to the highest planet, <a href="/d/goloka" class="d">Goloka</a> <a href="/d/vrndavana" class="d">V&#7771;nd&#257;vana</a>. His only objective is to serve <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> wherever he may be.</div>
<A NAME="7508"></A><div id="7508"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">A devotee of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is friendly to everyone. Therefore it is said here that he has no enemy. How is this? A devotee situated in <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness knows that only devotional service to <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> can relieve a person from all the problems of life. He has personal experience of this, and therefore he wants to introduce this system, <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness, into human society. There are many examples in history of devotees of the Lord risking their lives for the spreading of God consciousness. The favorite example is Lord Jesus Christ. He was crucified by the nondevotees, but He sacrificed His life for spreading God consciousness. Of course, it would be superficial to understand that He was killed. Similarly, in India also there are many examples, such as &#7788;h&#257;kur <a href="/d/haridasa" class="d">Harid&#257;sa</a>. Why such risk? Because they wanted to spread <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness, and it is difficult. A <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> conscious person knows that if a man is suffering, it is due to his forgetfulness of his eternal relationship with <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. Therefore, the highest benefit one can render to human society is relieving one's neighbor from all material problems. In such a way, a pure devotee is engaged in the service of the Lord. Now, we can imagine how merciful <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is to those engaged in His service, risking everything for Him. Therefore it is certain that such persons must reach the supreme planet after leaving the body.</div>

<div class="Normal-Level">In summary, the universal form of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, which is a temporary manifestation, and the form of time which devours everything, and even the form of <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a>, four-handed, have all been exhibited by <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. Thus <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is the origin of all these manifestations. It is not that <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is a manifestation of the original <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/visva" class="d">vi&#347;va</a>-<a href="/d/rupa" class="d">r&#363;pa</a>, </span>or <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a>. <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is the origin of all forms. There are hundreds and thousands of Vi&#7779;&#7751;us, but for a devotee, no form of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is important but the original form, two-handed &#346;y&#257;masundara. In the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahm&#257;</a>-<a href="/d/samhita" class="d">sa&#7745;hit&#257;</a> </span>it is stated that those who are attached to the &#346;y&#257;masundara form of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> in love and devotion can see Him always within the heart and cannot see anything else. One should understand, therefore, that the purport of this Eleventh Chapter is that the form of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is essential and supreme.</div>
