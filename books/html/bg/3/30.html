<div class="Translation">Therefore, O <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a>, surrendering all your works unto Me, with mind intent on Me, and without desire for gain and free from egoism and lethargy, fight.</div>
<A NAME="2452"></A><div id="2452"> </div>
<div class="Titles">PURPORT</div>
<A NAME="2453"></A><div id="2453"> </div>
<div class="Purport">This verse clearly indicates the purpose of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a>. </span>The Lord instructs that one has to become fully <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> conscious to discharge duties, as if in military discipline. Such an injunction may make things a little difficult; nevertheless duties must be carried out, with dependence on <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, because that is the constitutional position of the living entity. The living entity cannot be happy independant of the cooperation of the Supreme Lord because the eternal constitutional position of the living entity is to become subordinate to the desires of the Lord. <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> was, therefore, ordered by &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> to fight as if the Lord were his military commander. One has to sacrifice everything for the good will of the Supreme Lord, and at the same time discharge prescribed duties without claiming proprietorship. <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> did not have to consider the order of the Lord; he had only to execute His order. The Supreme Lord is the Soul of all souls; therefore, one who depends solely and wholly on the Supreme Soul without personal consideration, or in other words, one who is fully <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> conscious, is called <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/adhyatma" class="d">adhy&#257;tma</a>-<a href="/d/cetasa" class="d">cetas&#257;</a>. <a href="/d/nirasih" class="d">Nir&#257;&#347;&#299;&#7717;</a> </span>means that one has to act on the order of the master. Nor should one ever expect fruitive results. The cashier may count millions of dollars for his employer, but he does not claim a cent for himself. Similarly, one has to realize that nothing in the world belongs to any individual person, but that everything belongs to the Supreme Lord. That is the real purport of <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/mayi" class="d">mayi</a>, </span>or unto Me. And when one acts in such <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness, certainly he does not claim proprietorship over anything. This consciousness is called <span class="Italic">nirmama, </span>or nothing is mine. And, if there is any reluctance to execute such a stern order which is without consideration of so-called kinsmen in the bodily relationship, that reluctance should be thrown off; in this way one may become <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/vigata" class="d">vigata</a>-<a href="/d/jvara" class="d">jvara</a>, </span>or without feverish mentality or lethargy. Everyone, according to his quality and position, has a particular type of work to discharge, and all such duties may be discharged in <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness, as described above. That will lead one to the path of liberation.</div>
