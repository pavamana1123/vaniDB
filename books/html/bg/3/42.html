<div class="Titles">PURPORT</div>
<A NAME="2639"></A><div id="2639"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The senses are different outlets for the activities of lust. Lust is reserved within the body, but it is given vent through the senses. Therefore, the senses are superior to the body as a whole. These outlets are not in use when there is superior consciousness, or <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness. In <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness the soul makes direct connection with the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore the bodily functions, as described here, ultimately end in the Supreme Soul. Bodily action means the functions of the senses, and stopping the senses means stopping all bodily actions. But since the mind is active, then, even though the body may be silent and at rest, the mind will act&mdash;as it does during dreaming. But, above the mind there is the determination of the intelligence, and above the intelligence is the soul proper. If, therefore, the soul is directly engaged with the Supreme, naturally all other subordinates, namely, the intelligence, mind and the senses, will be automatically engaged. In the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/katha" class="d">Ka&#7789;ha</a> <a href="/d/upanisad" class="d">Upani&#7779;ad</a> </span>there is a passage in which it is said that the objects of sense gratification are superior to the senses, and mind is superior to the sense objects. If, therefore, the mind is directly engaged in the service of the Lord constantly, then there is no chance of the senses becoming engaged in other ways. This mental attitude has already been explained. If the mind is engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord, there is no chance of its being engaged in the lower propensities. In the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/katha" class="d">Ka&#7789;ha</a> <a href="/d/upanisad" class="d">Upani&#7779;ad</a> </span>the soul has been described as <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/mahan" class="d">mah&#257;n</a>, </span>the great. Therefore the soul is above all&mdash;namely, the sense objects, the senses, the mind and the intelligence. Therefore, directly understanding the constitutional position of the soul is the solution of the whole problem.</div>
	<A NAME="2640"></A><div id="2640"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">With intelligence one has to seek out the constitutional position of the soul and then engage the mind always in <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness. That solves the whole problem. A neophyte spiritualist is generally advised to keep aloof from the objects of senses. One has to strengthen the mind by use of intelligence. If by intelligence one engages one's mind in <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness, by complete surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then, automatically, the mind becomes stronger, and even though the senses are very strong, like serpents, they will be no more effective than serpents with broken fangs. But even though the soul is the master of intelligence and mind, and the senses also, still, unless it is strengthened by association with <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> in <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness, there is every chance of falling down due to the agitated mind.</div>
