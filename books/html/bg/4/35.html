<div class="Titles">PURPORT</div>
<A NAME="3218"></A><div id="3218"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The result of receiving knowledge from a self-realized soul, or one who knows things as they are, is learning that all living beings are parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. The sense of a separated existence from <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is called <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/maya" class="d">m&#257;y&#257;</a> (<a href="/d/ma" class="d">m&#257;</a></span>&mdash;not, <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/ya" class="d">y&#257;</a></span>&mdash;this). Some think that we have nothing to do with <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, that <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is only a great historical personality and that the Absolute is the impersonal <a href="/d/brahman" class="d">Brahman</a>. Factually, as it is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a>, </span>this impersonal <a href="/d/brahman" class="d">Brahman</a> is the personal effulgence of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the cause of everything. In the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/brahma" class="d">Brahma</a>-<a href="/d/samhita" class="d">sa&#7745;hit&#257;</a> </span>it is clearly stated that <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes. Even the millions of incarnations are only His different expansions. Similarly, the living entities are also expansions of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. The <a href="/d/mayavadi" class="d">M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;</a> philosophers wrongly think that <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> loses His own separate existence in His many expansions. This thought is material in nature. We have experience in the material world that a thing, when fragmentally distributed, loses its own original identity. But the <a href="/d/mayavadi" class="d">M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;</a> philosophers fail to understand that Absolute means that one plus one is equal to one, and that one minus one is also equal to one. This is the case in the absolute world.</div>
	<A NAME="3219"></A><div id="3219"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">For want of sufficient knowledge in the absolute science, we are now covered with illusion, and therefore we think that we are separate from <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. Although we are separated parts of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, we are nevertheless not different from Him. The bodily difference of the living entities is <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/maya" class="d">m&#257;y&#257;</a></span>, or not actual fact. We are all meant to satisfy <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. By <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/maya" class="d">m&#257;y&#257;</a></span> alone <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> thought that the temporary bodily relationship with his kinsmen was more important than his eternal spiritual relationship with <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. The whole teaching of the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/gita" class="d">G&#299;t&#257;</a></span> is targetted toward this end: that a living being, as His eternal servitor, cannot be separated from <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, and his sense of being an identity apart from <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is called <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/maya" class="d">m&#257;y&#257;</a></span>. The living entities, as separate parts and parcels of the Supreme, have a purpose to fulfill. Having forgotten that purpose, since time immemorial they are situated in different bodies, as men, animals, demigods, etc. Such bodily differences arise from forgetfulness of the transcendental service of the Lord. But when one is engaged in transcendental service through <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness, one becomes at once liberated from this illusion. One can acquire such pure knowledge only from the bona fide spiritual master and thereby avoid the delusion that the living entity is equal to <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. Perfect knowledge is that the Supreme Soul, <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, is the supreme shelter for all living entities, and giving up such shelter, the living entities are deluded by the material energy, imagining themselves to have a separate identity. Thus, under different standards of material identity, they become forgetful of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. When, however, such deluded living entities become situated in <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness, it is to be understood that they are on the path of liberation, as confirmed in the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a>: muktir hitv&#257;nyath&#257; <a href="/d/rupam" class="d">r&#363;pa&#7745;</a> <a href="/d/svarupena" class="d">svar&#363;pe&#7751;a</a> <a href="/d/vyavasthitih" class="d">vyavasthiti&#7717;</a>. </span>Liberation means to be situated in one's constitutional position as the eternal servitor of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> (<a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> consciousness).</div>
