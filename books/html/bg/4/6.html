<div class="Titles">PURPORT</div>
<A NAME="2765"></A><div id="2765"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The Lord has spoken about the peculiarity of His birth: although He may appear like an ordinary person, He remembers everything of His many, many past "births," whereas a common man cannot remember what he has done even a few hours before. If someone is asked what he did exactly at the same time one day earlier, it would be very difficult for a common man to answer immediately. He would surely have to dredge his memory to recall what he was doing exactly at the same time one day before. And yet, men often <a href="/d/dare" class="d">dare</a> claim to be God, or <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. One should not be misled by such meaningless claims. Then again, the Lord explains His <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/prakrti" class="d">prak&#7771;ti</a> </span>or His form. <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/prakrti" class="d">Prak&#7771;ti</a> </span>means nature as well as <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/svarupa" class="d">svar&#363;pa</a>, </span>or one's own form. The Lord says that He appears in His own body. He does not change His body, as the common living entity changes from one body to another. The conditioned soul may have one kind of body in the present birth, but he has a different body in the next birth. In the material world, the living entity has no fixed body but transmigrates from one body to another. The Lord, however, does not do so. Whenever He appears, He does so in the same original body, by His internal potency. In other words, <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> appears in this material world in His original eternal form, with two hands, holding a flute. He appears exactly in His eternal body, uncontaminated by this material world. Although He appears in the same transcendental body and is Lord of the universe, it still appears that He takes His birth like an ordinary living entity. Despite the fact Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> grows from childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth, astonishingly enough He never ages beyond youth. At the time of the Battle of <a href="/d/kuruksetra" class="d">Kuruk&#7779;etra</a>, He had many grandchildren at home; or, in other words, He had sufficiently aged by material calculations. Still He looked just like a young man twenty or twenty-five years old. We never see a picture of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> in old age because He never grows old like us, although He is the oldest person in the whole creation&mdash;past, present, and future. Neither His body nor His intelligence ever deteriorates or changes. Therefore, it is clear that in spite of His being in the material world, He is the same unborn, eternal form of bliss and knowledge, changeless in His transcendental body and intelligence. Factually, His appearance and disappearance are like the sun's rising, moving before us, and then disappearing from our eyesight. When the sun is out of sight, we think that the sun is set, and when the sun is before our eyes, we think that the sun is on the horizon. Actually, the sun is always in its fixed position, but owing to our defective, insufficient senses, we calculate the appearance and disappearance of the sun in the sky. And, because His appearance and disappearance are completely different from that of any ordinary, common living entity, it is evident that He is eternal, blissful knowledge by His internal potency&mdash;and He is never contaminated by material nature. The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> also confirm that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is unborn, yet He still appears to take His birth in multi-manifestations. The Vedic supplementary literatures also confirm that even though the Lord appears to be taking His birth, He is still without change of body. In the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a>, </span>He appears before His mother as <a href="/d/narayana" class="d">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</a>, with four hands and the decorations of the six kinds of full opulences. His appearance in His original eternal form is His causeless mercy, according to the <span class="Italic">Vi&#347;vako&#347;a </span>dictionary. The Lord is conscious of all of His previous appearances and disappearances, but a common living entity forgets everything about his past body as soon as he gets another body. He is the Lord of all living entities because He performs wonderful and superhuman activities while He is on this earth. Therefore, the Lord is always the same Absolute Truth and is without differentiation between His form and self, or between His quality and body. A question may now be raised as to why the Lord appears and disappears in this world. This is explained in the next verse.</div>
