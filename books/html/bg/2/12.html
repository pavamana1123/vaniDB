<div class="After-Verse">The same Vedic truth given to <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a> is given to all persons in the world who <a href="/d/pose" class="d">pose</a> themselves as very learned but factually have but a poor fund of knowledge. The Lord says clearly that He Himself, <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a>, and all the kings who are assembled on the battlefield, are eternally individual beings and that the Lord is eternally the maintainer of the individual living entities both in their conditioned as well as in their liberated situations. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the supreme individual person, and <a href="/d/arjuna" class="d">Arjuna</a>, the Lord's eternal associate, and all the kings assembled there are individual, eternal persons. It is not that they did not exist as individuals in the past, and it is not that they will not remain eternal persons. Their individuality existed in the past, and their individuality will continue in the future without interruption. Therefore, there is no cause for lamentation for anyone.</div>
<A NAME="1006"></A><div id="1006"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The <a href="/d/mayavadi" class="d">M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;</a> theory that after liberation the individual soul, separated by the covering of <a href="/d/maya" class="d">m&#257;y&#257;</a> or illusion, will merge into the impersonal <a href="/d/brahman" class="d">Brahman</a> and lose its individual existence is not supported herein by Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, the supreme authority. Nor is the theory that we only think of individuality in the conditioned state supported herein. <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> clearly says herein that in the future also the individuality of the Lord and others, as it is confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Upani&#7779;ads, </span>will continue eternally. This statement of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is authoritative because <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> cannot be subject to illusion. If individuality is not a fact, then <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> would not have stressed it so much&mdash;even for the future. The <a href="/d/mayavadi" class="d">M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;</a> may argue that the individuality spoken of by <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is not spiritual, but material. Even accepting the argument that the individuality is material, then how can one distinguish K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's individuality? <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> affirms His individuality in the past and confirms His individuality in the future also. He has confirmed His individuality in many ways, and impersonal <a href="/d/brahman" class="d">Brahman</a> has been declared to be subordinate to Him. <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> has maintained spiritual individuality all along; if He is accepted as an ordinary conditioned soul in individual consciousness, then His <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a> </span>has no value as authoritative scripture. A common man with all the four defects of human frailty is unable to teach that which is worth hearing. The <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/gita" class="d">G&#299;t&#257;</a></span> is above such literature. No mundane book compares with the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a>. </span>When one accepts <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> as an ordinary man, the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/gita" class="d">G&#299;t&#257;</a> </span>loses all importance. The <a href="/d/mayavadi" class="d">M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;</a> argues that the plurality mentioned in this verse is conventional and that it refers to the body. But previous to this verse such a bodily conception is already condemned. After condemning the bodily conception of the living entities, how was it possible for <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> to place a conventional proposition on the body again? Therefore, individuality is maintained on spiritual grounds and is thus confirmed by great <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas </span>like &#346;r&#299; R&#257;m&#257;nuja and others. It is clearly mentioned in many places in the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/gita" class="d">G&#299;t&#257;</a> </span>that this spiritual individuality is understood by those who are devotees of the Lord. Those who are envious of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> as the Supreme Personality of Godhead have no bona fide access to the great literature. The nondevotee's approach to the teachings of the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/gita" class="d">G&#299;ta</a> </span>is something like bees licking on a bottle of honey. One cannot have a taste of honey unless one opens the bottle. Similarly, the mysticism of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a> </span>can be understood only by devotees, and no one else can taste it, as it is stated in the Fourth Chapter of the book. Nor can the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/gita" class="d">G&#299;t&#257;</a> </span>be touched by persons who envy the very existence of the Lord. Therefore, the <a href="/d/mayavadi" class="d">M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;</a> explanation of the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/gita" class="d">G&#299;t&#257;</a> </span>is a most misleading presentation of the whole truth. Lord <a href="/d/caitanya" class="d">Caitanya</a> has forbidden us to read commentations made by the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;s and warns that one who takes to such an understanding of the <a href="/d/mayavadi" class="d">M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;</a> philosophy loses all power to understand the real mystery of the <span class="Italic"><a href="/d/gita" class="d">G&#299;t&#257;</a>. </span>If individuality refers to the empirical universe, then there is no need of teaching by the Lord. The plurality of the individual soul and of the Lord is an eternal fact, and it is confirmed by the <span class="Italic">Vedas </span>as above mentioned.</div>
