<div class="Normal-Level">In the <I><a href="/d/hari" class="d">Hari</a>-<a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">bhakti</a>-<a href="/d/vilasa" class="d">vil&#257;sa</a></I> (Eleventh <I><a href="/d/vilasa" class="d">Vil&#257;sa</a>,</I> verses 127-140) there is a vivid description of what is required in Deity worship. There are sixty-four items mentioned. In the temple, worship should be so gorgeous that all sixty-four items should be available for the satisfaction of the Personality of Godhead. Sometimes it is impossible to get all sixty-four items; therefore we recommend that at least on the first day of installation all sixty-four items should be available. When the Lord is established, worship with all sixty-four items should continue as far as possible. The sixty-four items are as follows: (1) There must be a big bell hanging in front of the temple room so that whoever comes in the room can ring the bell. This item is called <I><a href="/d/prabodhana" class="d">prabodhana</a>,</I> or offering oneself submissively to the Lord. This is the first item. (2) The visitor must chant <I><a href="/d/jaya" class="d">jaya</a></I> &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/radha" class="d">R&#257;dh&#257;</a>-<a href="/d/govinda" class="d">Govinda</a>, or <I><a href="/d/jaya" class="d">jaya</a></I> &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/radha" class="d">R&#257;dh&#257;</a>-<a href="/d/madhava" class="d">M&#257;dhava</a> when he rings the bell. In either case, the word <I><a href="/d/jaya" class="d">jaya</a></I> must be uttered. (3) One should immediately offer obeisances to the Lord, falling down like a stick. (4) There must be regular <I><a href="/d/mangala" class="d">ma&#7749;gala</a>-<a href="/d/arati" class="d">&#257;rati</a></I> in the temple during the early morning, an hour and a half before the sun rises. (5) There must be an <I><a href="/d/asana" class="d">&#257;sana</a>,</I> a sitting place before the altar. This <I><a href="/d/asana" class="d">&#257;sana</a></I> is for the spiritual master. The disciple brings everything before the spiritual master, and the spiritual master offers everything to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. (6) After <I><a href="/d/mangala" class="d">ma&#7749;gala</a>-<a href="/d/arati" class="d">&#257;rati</a>,</I> the Deity is supposed to wash His teeth by using a twig; therefore a twig must be offered. (7) Water must be offered for washing the Deity's feet. (8) <I><a href="/d/arghya" class="d">Arghya</a></I> should be offered. (9) Water for <I><a href="/d/acamana" class="d">&#257;camana</a></I> should be offered. (10) <I><a href="/d/madhu" class="d">Madhu</a>-parka,</I> a small bowl containing <I><a href="/d/madhu" class="d">madhu</a></I> (honey, a little ghee, a little water, a little sugar, yogurt and milk) should be offered. This is called <I><a href="/d/madhu" class="d">madhu</a>-parka-<a href="/d/acamana" class="d">&#257;camana</a>.</I> (11) One should place wooden slippers before the Lord. (12) One should massage the body of the Lord. (13) One should massage the body of the Lord with oil. (14) With a soft, wet sponge one should remove all the oil smeared over the Lord's body. (15) One should bathe the Lord with water in which nicely scented flowers have been soaking for some time. (16) After bathing the body of the Lord with water, one should bathe Him with milk. (17) Then with yogurt. (18) Then with ghee. (19) Then with honey. (20) Then with sugar. (21) Then one should wash the Deity with water and chant this <I><a href="/d/mantra" class="d">mantra</a>:</I></div>

This may not be possible for everyone, but at least the <I><a href="/d/pujari" class="d">p&#363;j&#257;r&#299;</a></I> should do this. (57) The flowers offered on the previous day should touch one's head. (58) One should take the remnants of the Lord's food.

<div class="Verse-Text">&#256;rati should be offered to the Deities five times daily-early in the morning before sunrise, later in the morning, at noon, in the evening and at night. This means that there should be worship and a change of dress and flowers. As far as the eatables are concerned, all items should be first-class preparations. There should be first-class rice, dhal, fruit, sweet rice, vegetables and a variety of foods to be sucked, drunk and chewed. All the eatables offered to the Deities should be extraordinarily excellent. In Europe and America there is presently no monetary scarcity. People are not poor, and if they follow these principles of Deity worship, they will advance in spiritual life. As far as placing the Deity in the bed is concerned, if the Deity is large and heavy, it is not possible to move Him daily. It is better that a small Deity, which is also worshiped, be taken to the bed. This <I>mantra</I> should be chanted: <I>&#257;gaccha &#347;ayana-sth&#257;na&#7745; priy&#257;bhi&#7717; saha ke&#347;ava.</I> "O Ke&#347;ava, kindly come to Your bed along with &#346;r&#299;mat&#299; R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;&#7751;&#299;." (<I>Hari-bhakti-vil&#257;sa</I> 11.40)</div>

<div class="Normal-Level">The Deity should be placed in bed with &#346;r&#299;mat&#299; R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;&#7751;&#299;, and this should be indicated by bringing the wooden slippers from the altar to the bedside. When the Deity is laid down, His legs should be massaged. Before laying the Deity down, a pot of milk and sugar should be offered to Him. After taking this thick milk, the Deity should lie down and should be offered betel nuts and spices to chew.</div>
