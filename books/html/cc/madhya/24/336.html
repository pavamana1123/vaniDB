<div class="Normal-Level">One should also notice the specific offenses against Deity worship. These are mentioned in the <I><a href="/d/skanda" class="d">Skanda</a> <a href="/d/purana" class="d">Pur&#257;&#7751;a</a> (Avant&#299;-<a href="/d/khanda" class="d">kha&#7751;&#7693;a</a>),</I> spoken by Vy&#257;sadeva himself.

To worship the Deity with the sixty-four items mentioned may be a difficult job, but the Lord has become so small that anyone in any temple can carefully handle Deity worship simply by performing the same activities with <I><a href="/d/salagrama" class="d">&#347;&#257;lagr&#257;ma</a>-<a href="/d/sila" class="d">&#347;il&#257;</a>.</I></div>
