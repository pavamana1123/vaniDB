The second <I><a href="/d/sandarbha" class="d">Sandarbha</a>,</I> called <I><a href="/d/bhagavat" class="d">Bhagavat</a>-<a href="/d/sandarbha" class="d">sandarbha</a>,</I> draws a distinction between impersonal <a href="/d/brahman" class="d">Brahman</a> and localized <a href="/d/paramatma" class="d">Param&#257;tm&#257;</a> and describes the spiritual world and the domination of the mode of goodness devoid of contamination by the other two material modes. In other words, there is a vivid description of the transcendental position known as <I><a href="/d/suddha" class="d">&#347;uddha</a>-<a href="/d/sattva" class="d">sattva</a>.</I> Material goodness is apt to be contaminated by the other two material qualities-ignorance and passion-but when one is situated in the <I><a href="/d/suddha" class="d">&#347;uddha</a>-<a href="/d/sattva" class="d">sattva</a></I> position, there is no chance for such contamination. It is a spiritual platform of pure goodness. The potency of the Supreme Lord and the living entity is also described, and there is a description of the inconceivable energies and varieties of energies of the Lord. The potencies are divided into categories-internal, external, personal, marginal and so forth. There are also discussions of the eternality of Deity worship, the omnipotence of the Deity, His all-pervasiveness, His giving shelter to everyone, His subtle and gross potencies, His personal manifestations, His expressions of form, quality and pastimes, His transcendental position and His complete form. It is also stated that everything pertaining to the Absolute has the same potency and that the spiritual world, the associates in the spiritual world and the threefold energies of the Lord in the spiritual world are all transcendental. There are further discussions concerning the difference between the impersonal <a href="/d/brahman" class="d">Brahman</a> and the Personality of Godhead, the fullness of the Personality of Godhead, the objective of all Vedic knowledge, the personal potencies of the Lord, and the Personality of Godhead as the original author of Vedic knowledge.</div>

There are discussions of the differences between the qualitative incarnations, and discourses concerning the living entities, <I><a href="/d/maya" class="d">m&#257;y&#257;</a>,</I> the material world, the theory of transformation, the illusory energy, the sameness of this world and the Supersoul, and the truth about this material world. In this connection, the opinions of &#346;r&#299;dhara <a href="/d/svami" class="d">Sv&#257;m&#299;</a> are given. It is stated that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although devoid of material qualities, superintends all material activities.

The opinions of &#346;r&#299;dhara <a href="/d/svami" class="d">Sv&#257;m&#299;</a> are corroborated. In each and every scripture, the supremacy of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> is stressed. <a href="/d/baladeva" class="d">Baladeva</a>, <a href="/d/sankarsana" class="d">Sa&#7749;kar&#7779;a&#7751;a</a> and other expansions of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> are emanations of <a href="/d/maha" class="d">Mah&#257;</a>-<a href="/d/sankarsana" class="d">Sa&#7749;kar&#7779;a&#7751;a</a>.

Worship of the demigods is discouraged, and worship of a <a href="/d/vaisnava" class="d">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava</a> is considered exalted. No respect is given to the nondevotees. There are discussions of how one can be liberated even in this life (<I><a href="/d/jivan" class="d">j&#299;van</a>-<a href="/d/mukta" class="d">mukta</a></I>), Lord &#346;iva as a devotee, and how a <I><a href="/d/bhakta" class="d">bhakta</a></I> and his devotional service are eternally existing. It is stated that through <I><a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">bhakti</a></I> one can attain all success because for <I><a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">bhakti</a></I> is transcendental to the material qualities. There is a discussion of how the self is manifest through <I><a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">bhakti</a>.</I> There is also a discussion of the self's bliss, as well as how <I><a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">bhakti</a>,</I> even imperfectly executed, enables one to attain the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Unmotivated devotional service is highly praised, and an explanation is given of how each devotee can achieve the platform of unmotivated service by association with other devotees.

<div class="Normal-Level">The sixth <I><a href="/d/sandarbha" class="d">Sandarbha</a></I> is called <I><a href="/d/priti" class="d">Pr&#299;ti</a>-<a href="/d/sandarbha" class="d">sandarbha</a>,</I> a thesis on love of Godhead. Here it is stated that through love of Godhead, one becomes perfectly liberated and attains the highest goal of life. A distinction is made between the liberated condition of a personalist and that of an impersonalist, and there is a discussion of liberation during one's lifetime as distinguished from liberation from material bondage. Of all kinds of liberation, liberation in loving service to the Lord is described as the most exalted, and meeting the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face is shown to be the highest perfection of life. Immediate liberation is contrasted with liberation by a gradual process. Both realization of <a href="/d/brahman" class="d">Brahman</a> and meeting with the Supreme Personality of Godhead are described as liberation within one's lifetime, but meeting with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, both internally and externally, is shown to be superexcellent, above the transcendental realization of the <a href="/d/brahman" class="d">Brahman</a> effulgence. There is a comparative study of liberation as <I><a href="/d/salokya" class="d">s&#257;lokya</a>, <a href="/d/samipya" class="d">s&#257;m&#299;pya</a></I> and <I><a href="/d/sarupya" class="d">s&#257;r&#363;pya</a>.</I> <I><a href="/d/samipya" class="d">S&#257;m&#299;pya</a></I> is better than <I><a href="/d/salokya" class="d">s&#257;lokya</a>.</I> Devotional service is considered to be liberation with greater facilities, and there is a discussion of how to obtain it. There are also discussions of the transcendental state one achieves after attaining the devotional platform, which is the exact position of love of Godhead; the marginal symptoms of transcendental love, and how it is awakened; the distinction between so-called love and transcendental love on the platform of love of Godhead; and different types of humors and mellows enjoyed in relishing the lusty affairs of the <I>gop&#299;s,</I> which are different from mundane affairs, which in turn are symbolical representations of pure love for <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. There are also discussions of <I><a href="/d/bhakti" class="d">bhakti</a></I> mixed with philosophical speculation, the superexcellence of the love of the <I>gop&#299;s,</I> the difference between opulent devotional service and loving devotional service, the exalted position of the residents of <a href="/d/gokula" class="d">Gokula</a>, the progressively exalted position of the friends of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, the <I>gopas</I> and the <I>gop&#299;s</I> in parental love with <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, and finally the superexcellence of the love of the <I>gop&#299;s</I> and that of &#346;r&#299;mat&#299; R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;&#7751;&#299;. There is also a discussion of how spiritual feelings can be present when one simply imitates them and of how such mellows are far superior to the ordinary mellows of mundane love, and there are descriptions of different ecstasies, the awakening of ecstasy, transcendental qualities, the distinction of <I>dh&#299;rod&#257;tta,</I> the utmost attractiveness of conjugal love, the ecstatic features, the permanent ecstatic features, the mellows divided in five transcendental features of direct loving service, and indirect loving service, considered in seven divisions. Finally there is a discussion of overlapping of different <I>rasas,</I> and there are discussions of <I><a href="/d/santa" class="d">&#347;&#257;nta</a></I> (neutrality), servitorship, taking shelter, parental love, conjugal love, direct transcendental enjoyment and enjoyment in separation, previous attraction and the glories of &#346;r&#299;mat&#299; R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;&#7751;&#299;.</div>
