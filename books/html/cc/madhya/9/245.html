<div class="Normal-Level">In his childhood Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya was known as <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">V&#257;sudeva</a>, and there are some wonderful stories surrounding him. It is said that once when his father had piled up many debts, Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya converted tamarind seeds into actual coins to pay them off. When he was five years old, he was offered the sacred thread. A demon named <a href="/d/maniman" class="d">Ma&#7751;im&#257;n</a> lived near his abode in the form of a snake, and at the age of five Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya killed that snake with the toe of his left foot. When his mother was very much disturbed, he would appear before her in one jump. He was a great scholar even in childhood, and although his father did not agree, he accepted <I><a href="/d/sannyasa" class="d">sanny&#257;sa</a></I> at the age of twelve. Upon receiving <I><a href="/d/sannyasa" class="d">sanny&#257;sa</a></I> from <a href="/d/acyuta" class="d">Acyuta</a> <a href="/d/preksa" class="d">Prek&#7779;a</a>, he received the name P&#363;r&#7751;apraj&ntilde;a <a href="/d/tirtha" class="d">T&#299;rtha</a>. After traveling all over India, he finally discussed scriptures with Vidy&#257;&#347;a&#7749;kara, the exalted leader of <a href="/d/srngeri" class="d">S&#7771;&#7749;geri</a>-<a href="/d/matha" class="d">ma&#7789;ha</a>. Vidy&#257;&#347;a&#7749;kara was actually diminished in the presence of Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya. Accompanied by <a href="/d/satya" class="d">Satya</a> <a href="/d/tirtha" class="d">T&#299;rtha</a>, Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya went to Badarik&#257;&#347;rama. It was there that he met Vy&#257;sadeva and explained his commentary on the <I>Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></I> before him. Thus he became a great scholar by studying before Vy&#257;sadeva.</div>
<A NAME="172205"></A><div id="172205"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">By the time he came to the &#256;nanda-<a href="/d/matha" class="d">ma&#7789;ha</a> from Badarik&#257;&#347;rama, Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya had finished his commentary on the <I>Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a>.</I> His companion <a href="/d/satya" class="d">Satya</a> <a href="/d/tirtha" class="d">T&#299;rtha</a> wrote down the entire commentary. When Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya returned from Badarik&#257;&#347;rama, he went to Ga&ntilde;j&#257;ma, which is on the bank of the river <a href="/d/godavari" class="d">God&#257;var&#299;</a>. There he met with two learned scholars named &#346;obhana <a href="/d/bhatta" class="d">Bha&#7789;&#7789;a</a> and <a href="/d/svami" class="d">Sv&#257;m&#299;</a> &#346;&#257;str&#299;. Later these scholars became known in the disciplic succession of Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya as <a href="/d/padmanabha" class="d">Padman&#257;bha</a> <a href="/d/tirtha" class="d">T&#299;rtha</a> and <a href="/d/narahari" class="d">Narahari</a> <a href="/d/tirtha" class="d">T&#299;rtha</a>. When he returned to U&#7693;up&#299;, he would sometimes bathe in the ocean. On such an occasion he composed a prayer in five chapters. Once, while sitting beside the sea engrossed in meditation upon Lord &#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, he saw that a large boat containing goods for <a href="/d/dvaraka" class="d">Dv&#257;rak&#257;</a> was in danger. He gave some signs by which the boat could approach the shore, and it was saved. The owners of the boat wanted to give him a present, and at the time Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya agreed to take some <I><a href="/d/gopi" class="d">gop&#299;</a>-<a href="/d/candana" class="d">candana</a>.</I> He received a big lump of <I><a href="/d/gopi" class="d">gop&#299;</a>-<a href="/d/candana" class="d">candana</a>,</I> and as it was being brought to him, it broke apart and revealed a large Deity of Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>. The Deity had a stick in one hand and a lump of food in the other. As soon as Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya received the Deity of <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> in this way, he composed a prayer. The Deity was so heavy that not even thirty people could lift it. Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya personally brought this Deity to U&#7693;up&#299;. Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya had eight disciples, all of whom took <I><a href="/d/sannyasa" class="d">sanny&#257;sa</a></I> from him and became directors of his eight monasteries. Worship of the Lord <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a> Deity is still going on at U&#7693;up&#299; according to the plans Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya established.</div>

<div class="Normal-Level">Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya then for the second time visited Badarik&#257;&#347;rama. While he was passing through Maharashtra, the local king was digging a big lake for the public benefit. As Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya passed through that area with his disciples, he was also obliged to help in the excavation. After some time, when Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya visited the king, he engaged the king in that work and departed with his disciples.</div>

<div class="Normal-Level">Often in the province of <a href="/d/ganga" class="d">G&#257;&#7749;ga</a>-<a href="/d/pradesa" class="d">prade&#347;a</a> there were fights between Hindus and Muslims. The Hindus were on one bank of the river, and the Muslims on the other. Due to the community tension, no boat was available for crossing the river. The Muslim soldiers were always stopping passengers on the other side, but Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya did not care for these soldiers. He crossed the river anyway, and when he met the soldiers on the other side, he was brought before the king. The Muslim king was so pleased with him that he wanted to give him a kingdom and some money, but Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya refused. While walking on the road, he was attacked by some dacoits, but by his bodily strength he killed them all. When his companion <a href="/d/satya" class="d">Satya</a> <a href="/d/tirtha" class="d">T&#299;rtha</a> was attacked by a tiger, Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya separated them by virtue of his great strength. When he met Vy&#257;sadeva, he received from him the <I><a href="/d/salagrama" class="d">&#347;&#257;lagr&#257;ma</a>-<a href="/d/sila" class="d">&#347;il&#257;</a></I> known as A&#7779;&#7789;am&#363;rti. After this, he summarized the <I>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata.</I></div>

<div class="Normal-Level">Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya's devotion to the Lord and his erudite scholarship became known throughout India. Consequently the owners of the &#346;&#7771;&#7749;geri-<a href="/d/matha" class="d">ma&#7789;ha</a>, established by &#346;a&#7749;kar&#257;c&#257;rya, became a little perturbed. At that time the followers of &#346;a&#7749;kar&#257;c&#257;rya were afraid of Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya's rising power, and they began to tease Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya's disciples in many ways. There was even an attempt to prove that the disciplic succession of Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya was not in line with Vedic principles. A person named <a href="/d/pundarika" class="d">Pu&#7751;&#7693;ar&#299;ka</a> <a href="/d/puri" class="d">Pur&#299;</a>, a follower of the <a href="/d/mayavada" class="d">M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;da</a> philosophy of &#346;a&#7749;kar&#257;c&#257;rya, came before Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya to discuss the <I>&#347;&#257;stras.</I> It is said that all of Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya's books were taken away, but later they were found with the help of King Jayasi&#7745;ha, ruler of Kumla. In discussion, <a href="/d/pundarika" class="d">Pu&#7751;&#7693;ar&#299;ka</a> <a href="/d/puri" class="d">Pur&#299;</a> was defeated by Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya. A great personality named Trivikram&#257;c&#257;rya, who was a resident of Vi&#7779;&#7751;uma&#7749;gala, became Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya's disciple, and his son later became N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;&#257;c&#257;rya, the composer of <I>&#346;r&#299; <a href="/d/madhva" class="d">Madhva</a>-<a href="/d/vijaya" class="d">vijaya</a>.</I> After the death of Trivikram&#257;c&#257;rya, the younger brother of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;&#257;c&#257;rya took <I><a href="/d/sannyasa" class="d">sanny&#257;sa</a></I> and later became known as <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a> <a href="/d/tirtha" class="d">T&#299;rtha</a>.</div>

<div class="Normal-Level">It was reputed that there was no limit to the bodily strength of P&#363;r&#7751;apraj&ntilde;a, Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya.

Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya placed the big toe of his foot upon the ground and asked the man to separate it from the ground, but the great strong man could not do so even after great effort. &#346;r&#299;la Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya passed from this material world at the age of eighty while writing a commentary on the <I>Aitareya <a href="/d/upanisad" class="d">Upani&#7779;ad</a>.</I> For further information about Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya, one should read <I><a href="/d/madhva" class="d">Madhva</a>-<a href="/d/vijaya" class="d">vijaya</a>,</I> by N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;&#257;c&#257;rya.</div>
