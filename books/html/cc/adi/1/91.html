It propounds the highest principle of eternal religion, which can factually mitigate the threefold miseries of a living being and award the highest benediction of full prosperity and knowledge. Those willing to hear the message of this scripture in a submissive attitude of service can at once capture the Supreme Lord in their hearts.

<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Normal-Level">This verse appears in <I>&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a></I> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/1/1/2?d=1">1.1.2</a>). The words <I><a href="/d/maha" class="d">mah&#257;</a>-<a href="/d/muni" class="d">muni</a>-<a href="/d/krte" class="d">k&#7771;te</a></I> indicate that <I>&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a></I> was compiled by the great sage Vy&#257;sadeva, who is sometimes known as <a href="/d/narayana" class="d">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</a> <a href="/d/maha" class="d">Mah&#257;</a>-<a href="/d/muni" class="d">muni</a> because he is an incarnation of <a href="/d/narayana" class="d">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</a>. Vy&#257;sadeva, therefore, is not an ordinary man, but is empowered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He compiled the beautiful <I><a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a></I> to narrate some of the pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His devotees.</div>
</div><A NAME="129752"></A><div id="129752"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">In <I>&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a>,</I> a distinction between real religion and pretentious religion has been clearly made. According to this original and genuine commentation on the <I><a href="/d/vedanta" class="d">Ved&#257;nta</a>-<a href="/d/sutra" class="d">s&#363;tra</a>,</I> there are numerous pretentious faiths that pass as religion but neglect the real essence of religion. The real religion of a living being is his natural inborn quality, whereas pretentious religion is a form of nescience that artificially covers a living entity's pure consciousness under certain unfavorable conditions. Real religion lies dormant when artificial religion dominates from the mental plane. A living being can awaken this dormant religion by hearing with a pure heart.</div>
<A NAME="129753"></A><div id="129753"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The path of religion prescribed by <I>&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a></I> is different from all forms of imperfect religiosity. Religion can be considered in the following three divisions: (1) the path of fruitive work, (2) the path of knowledge and mystic powers, and (3) the path of worship and devotional service.</div>
<A NAME="129754"></A><div id="129754"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The path of fruitive work (<I><a href="/d/karma" class="d">karma</a>-<a href="/d/kanda" class="d">k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a</a></I>), even when decorated by religious ceremonies meant to elevate one's material condition, is a cheating process because it can never enable one to gain relief from material existence and achieve the highest goal. A living entity perpetually struggles hard to rid himself of the pangs of material existence, but the path of fruitive work leads him to either temporary happiness or temporary distress in material existence. By pious fruitive work a person is placed in a position where he can temporarily feel material happiness, whereas vicious activities lead him to a distressful position of material want and scarcity. However, even if a person is put into the most perfect situation of material happiness, he cannot in that way become free from the pangs of birth, death, old age and disease. A materially happy person is therefore in need of the eternal relief that mundane religiosity in terms of fruitive work can never award.</div>
<A NAME="129755"></A><div id="129755"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The paths of the culture of knowledge (<I><a href="/d/jnana" class="d">j&ntilde;&#257;na</a>-<a href="/d/marga" class="d">m&#257;rga</a></I>) and of mystic powers (<I><a href="/d/yoga" class="d">yoga</a>-<a href="/d/marga" class="d">m&#257;rga</a></I>) are equally hazardous, for one does not know where one will go by following these uncertain methods. An empiric philosopher in search of spiritual knowledge may endeavor most laboriously for many, many births in mental speculation, but unless and until he reaches the stage of the purest quality of goodness-in other words, until he transcends the plane of material speculation-it is not possible for him to know that everything emanates from the Personality of Godhead <a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">V&#257;sudeva</a>. His attachment to the impersonal feature of the Supreme Lord makes him unfit to rise to that transcendental stage of <I><a href="/d/vasudeva" class="d">vasudeva</a></I> understanding, and therefore because of his unclean state of mind he glides down again into material existence, even after having ascended to the highest stage of liberation. This falldown takes place due to his want of a <I>locus standi</I> in the service of the Supreme Lord.</div>
<A NAME="129756"></A><div id="129756"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">As far as the mystic powers of the <I>yog&#299;s</I> are concerned, they are also material entanglements on the path of spiritual realization. One German scholar who became a devotee of Godhead in India said that material science had already made laudable progress in duplicating the mystic powers of the <I>yog&#299;s.</I> He therefore came to India not to learn the methods of the <I>yog&#299;s</I>' mystic powers but to learn the path of transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord, as mentioned in the great scripture <I>&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a>.</I> Mystic powers can make a <I><a href="/d/yogi" class="d">yog&#299;</a></I> materially powerful and thus give temporary relief from the miseries of birth, death, old age and disease, as other material sciences can also do, but such mystic powers can never be a permanent source of relief from these miseries. Therefore, according to the <I><a href="/d/bhagavata" class="d">Bh&#257;gavata</a></I> school, this path of religiosity is also a method of cheating its followers. In the <I>Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a></I> it is clearly defined that the most elevated and powerful mystic <I>yog&#299;s</I> one who can constantly think of the Supreme Lord within his heart and engage in the loving service of the Lord.</div>
<A NAME="129757"></A><div id="129757"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The path of worship of the innumerable <I>devas,</I> or administrative demigods, is still more hazardous and uncertain than the above-mentioned processes of <I><a href="/d/karma" class="d">karma</a>-<a href="/d/kanda" class="d">k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a</a></I> and <I><a href="/d/jnana" class="d">j&ntilde;&#257;na</a>-<a href="/d/kanda" class="d">k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a</a>.</I> This system of worshiping many gods, such as <a href="/d/durga" class="d">Durg&#257;</a>, &#346;iva, <a href="/d/ganesa" class="d">Ga&#7751;e&#347;a</a>, <a href="/d/surya" class="d">S&#363;rya</a> and the impersonal <a href="/d/visnu" class="d">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u</a> form, is accepted by persons who have been blinded by an intense desire for sense gratification. When properly executed in terms of the rites mentioned in the <I>&#347;&#257;stras,</I> which are now very difficult to perform in this age of want and scarcity, such worship can certainly fulfill one's desires for sense gratification, but the success obtained by such methods is certainly transient, and it is suitable only for a less intelligent person. That is the verdict of the <I>Bhagavad-<a href="/d/gita" class="d">g&#299;t&#257;</a>.</I> No sane man should be satisfied by such temporary benefits.</div>
<A NAME="129758"></A><div id="129758"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">None of the above-mentioned three religious paths can deliver a person from the threefold miseries of material existence, namely, miseries caused by the body and mind, miseries caused by other living entities, and miseries caused by the demigods. The process of religion described in <I>&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a>,</I> however, is able to give its followers permanent relief from the threefold miseries. The <I><a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a></I> describes the highest religious form-reinstatement of the living entity in his original position of transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord, which is free from the infections of desires for sense gratification, fruitive work, and the culture of knowledge with the aim of merging into the Absolute to become one with the Supreme Lord.</div>
<A NAME="129759"></A><div id="129759"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Any process of religiosity based on sense gratification, gross or subtle, must be considered a pretentious religion because it is unable to give perpetual protection to its followers. The word <I><a href="/d/projjhita" class="d">projjhita</a></I> is significant. <I><a href="/d/pra" class="d">Pra</a></I> means "complete," and <I><a href="/d/ujjhita" class="d">ujjhita</a></I> indicates rejection. Religiosity in the shape of fruitive work is directly a method of gross sense gratification, whereas the process of culturing spiritual knowledge with a view to becoming one with the Absolute is a method of subtle sense gratification. All such pretentious religiosity based on gross or subtle sense gratification is completely rejected in the process of <I><a href="/d/bhagavata" class="d">bh&#257;gavata</a>-<a href="/d/dharma" class="d">dharma</a>,</I> or the transcendental religion that is the eternal function of the living being.</div>
<A NAME="129760"></A><div id="129760"> </div>
<div class="Verse-Text">Bh&#257;gavata-dharma, or the religious principle described in <I>&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</I> of which the <I>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</I> is a preliminary study, is meant for liberated persons of the highest order who attribute very little value to the sense gratification of pretentious religiosity. The first and foremost concern of fruitive workers, elevationists, empiric philosophers and salvationists is to raise their material position. But devotees of Godhead have no such selfish desires. They serve the Supreme Lord only for His satisfaction. &#346;r&#299; Arjuna, wanting to satisfy his senses by becoming a so-called nonviolent and pious man, at first decided not to fight. But when he was fully situated in the principles of <I>bh&#257;gavata-dharma,</I> culminating in complete surrender unto the will of the Supreme Lord, he changed his decision and agreed to fight for the satisfaction of the Lord. He then said:</div>
<A NAME="129761"></A><div id="129761"> </div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in; text-align : center"><div class="Verse-Text">na&#7779;&#7789;o moha&#7717; sm&#7771;tir labdh&#257;<br>tvat-pras&#257;d&#257;n may&#257;cyuta<br>sthito 'smi gata-sandeha&#7717;<br>kari&#7779;ye vacana&#7745; tava</div>
</div><A NAME="129762"></A><div id="129762"> </div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Normal-Level">"My dear <a href="/d/krsna" class="d">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</a>, O infallible one, my illusion is now gone. I have regained my memory by Your mercy. I am now firm and free from doubt and am prepared to act according to Your instructions." (Bg. <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/18/73?d=1">18.73</a>) It is the constitutional position of a living entity to be situated in this pure consciousness. Any so-called religious process that interferes with this unadulterated spiritual position of the living being must therefore be considered a pretentious process of religiosity.</div>
</div><A NAME="129763"></A><div id="129763"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The real form of religion is spontaneous loving service to Godhead. This relationship of the living being with the Absolute Personality of Godhead in service is eternal. The Personality of Godhead is described as <I><a href="/d/vastu" class="d">vastu</a>,</I> or the Substance, and the living entities are described as <I>v&#257;stavas,</I> or the innumerable samples of the Substance in relative existence. The relationship of these substantive portions with the Supreme Substance can never be annihilated, for it is an eternal quality inherent in the living being.</div>
<A NAME="129764"></A><div id="129764"> </div>
<div class="Normal-Level">By contact with material nature the living entities exhibit varied symptoms of the disease of material consciousness. To cure this material disease is the supreme object of human life. The process that treats this disease is called <I><a href="/d/bhagavata" class="d">bh&#257;gavata</a>-<a href="/d/dharma" class="d">dharma</a>,</I> or <I><a href="/d/sanatana" class="d">san&#257;tana</a>-<a href="/d/dharma" class="d">dharma</a></I>-real religion. This is described in the pages of <I>&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a>.</I> Therefore anyone who, because of his background of pious activities in previous lives, is anxious to hear <I>&#346;r&#299;mad-<a href="/d/bhagavatam" class="d">Bh&#257;gavatam</a></I> immediately realizes the presence of the Supreme Lord within his heart and fulfills the mission of his life.</div>
