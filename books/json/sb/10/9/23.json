	"translation": "In their former birth, these two sons, known as Nalakūvara and Maṇigrīva, were extremely opulent and fortunate. But because of pride and false prestige, they did not care about anyone, and thus Nārada Muni cursed them to become trees.\n \nThus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Tenth Canto, Ninth Chapter, of the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, entitled “Mother Yaśodā Binds Lord Kṛṣṇa.”"
