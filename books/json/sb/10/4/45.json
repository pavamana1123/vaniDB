The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change.” Irresponsible persons, surcharged with passion and ignorance, foolishly do things that are not to be done (nūnaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vikarma [SB 5.5.4]). But one should know the results of irresponsible actions, as explained in the next verse."
