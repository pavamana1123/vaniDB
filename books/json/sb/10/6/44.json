			"content": "The incident in which the great witch attempted to kill the child but was killed herself is certainly wonderful. Therefore this verse uses the word adbhutam, meaning “specifically wonderful.” Kṛṣṇa has left us many wonderful narrations about Him. Simply by reading these narrations, as they are described in Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one gains salvation from this material world and gradually develops attachment to and devotion for Govinda, Ādi-puruṣa."
