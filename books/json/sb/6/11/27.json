	"translation": "O my Lord, my master, I am wandering throughout this material world as a result of my fruitive activities. Therefore I simply seek friendship in the association of Your pious and enlightened devotees. My attachment to my body, wife, children and home is continuing by the spell of Your external energy, but I wish to be attached to them no longer. Let my mind, my consciousness and everything I have be attached only to You.\n \nThus end the Bhaktivedanta purports to the Sixth Canto, Eleventh Chapter, of the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, entitled “The Transcendental Qualities of Vṛtrāsura.”"
