	"translation": "My Lord, as the original boar within this universe, You fought and killed the great demon Hiraṇyakṣa.

I bow down before You.\n \nThus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fifth Canto, Eighteenth Chapter of the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, entitled, “The prayers Offered to the Lord by the Residents of Jambūdvīpa.”"
