	"synonyms": "yat—of which; upajoṣaṇāt—because of using the fragrant water; bhavānyāḥ—of Bhavānī, the wife of Lord Śiva; anucarīṇām—of attendant maidservants; puṇya-jana-vadhūnām—who are wives of the most pious Yakṣas; avayava—of the bodily limbs; sparśa—from contact; sugandha-vātaḥ—the wind, which becomes fragrant; daśa-yojanam—up to ten yojanas (about eighty miles); samantāt—all around; anuvāsayati—makes fragrant.",
	"translation": "The pious wives of the Yakṣas act as personal maidservants to assist Bhavānī, the wife of Lord Śiva. Because they drink the water of the River Aruṇodā, their bodies become fragrant, and as the air carries away that fragrance, it perfumes the entire atmosphere for eighty miles around."
