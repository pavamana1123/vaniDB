	"synonyms": "tvam—Your Lordship; vai—indeed; prajānām—of all living entities; sthira-jaṅgamānām—either stationary or moving; prajāpatīnām—of all the Prajāpatis; asi—You are; sambhaviṣṇuḥ—the generator of everyone; diva-okasām—of the inhabitants of the upper planetary system; deva—O Supreme Lord; divaḥ cyutānām—of the demigods, who have now fallen from their residential quarters; parāyaṇam—the supreme shelter; nauḥ—boat; iva—like; majjataḥ—of one drowning; apsu—in the water.",
	"translation": "My Lord, You are the original generator of all living entities, stationary or moving, and You are also the generator of the Prajāpatis. O my Lord, as a boat is the only hope for a person drowning in the water, You are the only shelter for the demigods, who are now bereft of their heavenly position.\n \nThus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Eighth Canto, Seventeenth Chapter, of the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, entitled “The Supreme Lord Agrees to Become Aditi’s Son.”"
