	"synonyms": "bhāva-grāhī—one who accepts the purpose; mahāprabhu—Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu; sneha—affection; mātra—only; laya—accepts; sukutā pātā—in leaves of sukutā; kāśandite—in kāśandi; mahā-sukha—much pleasure; pāya—gets.",
	"translation": "Since Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He extracts the purpose from everything. He accepted Damayantī's affection for Him, and therefore He derived great pleasure even from the dried bitter leaves of sukutā and from kāśandi [a sour condiment]."
