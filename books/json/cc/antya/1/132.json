			"content": "This verse (Vidagdha-mādhava 1.2) also appears in Ādi-līlā (1.4 and 3.4). In his commentary on Vidagdha-mādhava, Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī  Ṭhākura remarks: mahā-prabhoḥ sphūrtiṁ vinā hari-līlā-rasāsvādanānupapatter iti bhāvaḥ. Without the mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, one cannot describe the pastimes of the Supreme personality of Godhead. Therefore Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī said, vaḥ yuṣmākaṁ hṛdaya-rūpa-guhā yāṁ śacī-nandano hariḥ, pakṣe, siṁhaḥ sphuratu: \"May Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who is exactly like a lion that kills all the elephants of desire, be awakened within everyone's heart, for by His merciful blessings one can understand the transcendental pastimes of Kṛṣṇa.\""
