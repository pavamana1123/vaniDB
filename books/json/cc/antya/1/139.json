	"translation": "\"O learned devotees, I am by nature ignorant and low, yet even though it is from me that Vidagdha-mādhava has come, it is filled with descriptions of the transcendental attributes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, wiIl not such literature bring about the attainment of the highest goal of life? Although its wood may be ignited by a low-class ma, fire can nevertheless purify gold. Although I am very low by nature, this book may help cleanse the dirt from within the hearts of the golden devotees.' \"",
