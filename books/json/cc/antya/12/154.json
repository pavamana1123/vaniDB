	"translation": "Anyone who hears about the loving exchanges between Jagadānanda Paṇḍita and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, or who reads Jagadānanda's book Prema-vivarta, can understand what love is. Moreover, he achieves ecstatic love of Kṛṣṇa.",

			"type": "normal",
			"content": "The word vivarta means accepting something to be the opposite of what it appears. Here, Jagadānanda Paṇḍita appeared very angry, but this anger was a manifestation of his great love for Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Prema-vivarta is also the name of a book written by Jagadānanda Paṇḍita. Therefore the author of Caitanya-caritāmṛta, Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī, uses the words prema-vivarta to refer to one who reads the book or hears about Jagadānanda Paṇḍita's relationships with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. In either case, such a person very soon achieves love of Kṛṣṇa."
