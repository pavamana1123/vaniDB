Parameśvara informed the Lord that his wife, Mukundāra Mātā, had come with him. He should not have mentioned her, and therefore the Lord hesitated for a moment, but due to His affection for Parameśvara, He did not say anything. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu had known Parameśvara Modaka since His childhood, and therefore Parameśvara did not think twice about informing the Lord of his wife's arrival."
