Yadunandana Ācārya, one of the most confidential followers of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, was the initiated disciple of Advaita Ācārya. He was not polluted by sentimental distinctions classifying Vaiṣṇavas according to birth. Therefore although Vāsudeva Datta had not been born in a brāhmaṇa family, Yadunandana Ācārya accepted Vāsudeva Datta as his spiritual master."
