If one immediately follows the principles of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu by associating with His devotees, lusty desires for material enjoyment will vanish from one's heart. Then one will be able to understand the meaning of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam and the purpose of listening to it. Otherwise such understanding is impossible."
