The word puruṣa-adhama refers to the Personality of Godhead, under whom all other persons remain, or, in other words, puruṣa-uttama, the best of all living beings. Similarly, the word bandhu-han means \"the killer of māyā.\" In the conditioned state of life, one is closely related with māyā as a friend, but when one comes in contact with Kṛṣṇa one is freed from that relationship."
