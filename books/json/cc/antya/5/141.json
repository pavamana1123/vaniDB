	"translation": "\"When there is no one else to receive obeisances, one may be called 'anamra,' or one who offers obeisances to no one. This is the meaning of the word 'stabdha.' And because no one is found to be more learned than Kṛṣṇa, He may be called 'ajña,' indicating that nothing is unknown to Him."
