Vidagdha-ātmīya-vākya, however, refers to words written by a devotee who fully understands pure devotional service. Such devotees, who follow the paramparā system, are sometimes described as sajātīyāśaya-snigdha, or \"pleasing to the same class of people.\" Only the poetry and other writings of such devotees are accepted with great happiness by devotees."
