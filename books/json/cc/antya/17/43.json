	"synonyms": "nūpura—of the ankle bells; kiṅkinī—tinkling; dhvani—the sound; haṁsa—swans; sārasa—cranes; jini'-conquering; kaṅkaṇa-dhvani—the sound of bangles; caṭake—the caṭaka bird; lājāya—puts to shame; eka-bāra—once; yei—one who; śune—hears; vyāpi—expanding; rahe'-remains; tāra kāṇe—in his ear; anya—other; śabda—sound; se-kāṇe—in that ear; nā yāya—does not go.",
	"translation": "\"The tinkling of Kṛṣṇa's ankle bells surpasses the songs of even the swan and crane, and the sound of His bangles puts the singing of the caṭaka bird to shame. Having allowed these sounds to enter the ears even once, one cannot tolerate hearing anything else."
