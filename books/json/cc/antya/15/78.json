	"translation": "\"My dear friend, Kṛṣṇa's chest is as broad and attractive as a door made of indranīla gems, and His two arms, strong as bolts, can relieve the mental anguish of young girls distressed by lusty desires for Him. His body is cooler than the moon, sandalwood, the lotus flower and camphor. In this way, Madana-mohana, the attractor of Cupid, is increasing the desire of My breasts.\"",
