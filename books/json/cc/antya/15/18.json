	"translation": "\"My dear friend, if you say, 'Just try to control Your senses,' what shall I say? I cannot become angry at My senses. Is it their fault? Kṛṣṇa's beauty, sounds, touch, fragrance and taste are by nature extremely attractive. These five features are attracting My senses, and each wants to drag My mind in a different direction. Thus the life of My mind is in great danger, just like a horse ridden in five directions at once. Thus I am also in danger of dying."
