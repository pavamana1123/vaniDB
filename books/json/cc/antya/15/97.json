	"translation": "\"Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the topmost of all devotees. Sometimes, while walking on the beach, He would see a beautiful garden nearby and mistake it for the forest of Vṛndāvana. Thus He would be completely overwhelmed by ecstatic love of Kṛṣṇa and begin to dance and chant the holy name. His tongue worked incessantly as He chanted, 'Kṛṣṇa! Kṛṣṇa!' Will He again become visible before the path of My eyes?\"",
