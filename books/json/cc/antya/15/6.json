	"synonyms": "snāna—bathing; darśana—visiting the temple; bhojana—taking lunch; deha-svabhāve—by the nature of the body; haya—are; kumārera cāka—the potter's wheel; yena—as; satata—always; phiraya—revolves.",
	"translation": "Actually, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was always merged in ecstatic emotion, but just as a potter's wheel turns without the potter's touching it, the Lord's bodily activities, like bathing, going to the temple to see Lord Jagannātha, and taking lunch, went on automatically."
