	"translation": "\"My mind is just like a single horse being ridden by the five senses of perception, headed by sight. Each sense wants to ride that horse, and thus they pull My mind in five directions simultaneously. In what direction will it go? If they all pull at one time, certainly the horse will lose its life. How can I tolerate this atrocity?"
