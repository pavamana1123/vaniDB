	"translation": "\"The combined cooling effect of camphor, roots of khasakhasa and sandalwood is surpassed by the coolness of Kṛṣṇa's palms and the soles of His feet, which are cooler and more pleasing than millions upon millions of moons. If women are touched by them even once, their minds are enticed, and the burning poison of lusty desire for Kṛṣṇa is immediately vanquished.\""
