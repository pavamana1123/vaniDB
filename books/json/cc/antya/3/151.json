			"content": "In those days, and also even now, the palatial buildings of respectable people, especially in the villages of Bengal, were divided into two parts. The inside part was especially meant for the family, and the ladies would live there unexposed to men. That part was called the bhitara-bāḍi, or inside house. In the outside house, or bahir-bāḍi, the respectable gentleman received visitors and kept his business office. The Durgā-maṇḍapa would be part of the outside house. Thus when Lord Nityānanda entered the outside house, Rāmacandra Khān was in the inside house with the members of his family. When Nityānanda Prabhu arrived, Rāmacandra Khān did not receive Him personally but sent his servant to inform Him indirectly to go away."
