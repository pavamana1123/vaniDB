	"synonyms": "yadyapi—although; anya—another; saṅkete—by intimation; anya—that other; haya—is; nāma-ābhāsa—almost equal to the holy name; tathāpi—still; nāmera teja—the transcendental power of the holy name; nā haya vināśa—is not destroyed.",
	"translation": "Nāmācārya Haridāsa Ṭhākura, the authority on the chanting of the holy name, said, \"The chanting of the Lord's holy name to indicate something other than the Lord is an instance of nāmābhāsa. Even when the holy name is chanted in this way, its transcendental power is not destroyed."
