Haridāsa Ṭhākura was born in a Mohammedan family and was later recognized as a great Vaiṣṇava, but nevertheless the brāhmaṇas were very critical of him. Thus Haridāsa Ṭhākura was afraid that Advaita Ācārya would be put into some difficulty because of His familiarity with Haridāsa Ṭhākura. Śrī Advaita Ācārya treated Haridāsa Ṭhākura as a most elevated Vaiṣṇava, but others, like Rāmacandra Khān, were envious of Haridāsa Ṭhākura. Of course, we have to follow in the footsteps of Advaita Ācārya, not caring for people like Rāmacandra Khān. At present, many Vaiṣṇavas are coming to our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement from among the Europeans and Americans, and although a man like Rāmacandra Khān is always envious of such Vaiṣṇavas, one should follow in the footsteps of Śrī Advaita Ācārya by treating all of them as Vaiṣṇavas. Although they are not as exalted as Haridāsa Ṭhākura, such Americans and Europeans, having accepted the principles of Vaiṣṇava philosophy and behavior, should never be excluded from Vaiṣṇava society."
