Haridāsa Ṭhākura never advised the prostitute to give charity to the so-called daridra-nārāyaṇa (\"poor Nārāyaṇa\") or any other such persons. According to Vedic civilization, charity should be given only to the qualified brāhmaṇas. As stated in Bhagavad-gītā (18.42):"

Nārāyaṇa cannot be daridra, nor can daridra be Nārāyaṇa, for these are contradictory terms. Atheistic men invent such concoctions and preach them to fools, but charity should actually be given to brāhmaṇas and sannyāsīs because whatever money they get they spend for Kṛṣṇa. Whatever charity one gives to a brāhmaṇa goes to Kṛṣṇa, who says in Bhagavad-gītā (9.27):"

This is the mistake of materialistic civilization. The prostitute (veśyā) had earned money by questionable means, and therefore Haridāsa Ṭhākura advised her to distribute to the brāhmaṇas whatever she possessed. When Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī retired from family life, he distributed fifty percent of his income to the brāhmaṇas and Vaiṣṇavas. A brāhmaṇa knows what the Absolute Truth is, and a Vaiṣṇava, knowing the Absolute Truth, acts on behalf of the Absolute Truth, the Supreme personality of Godhead. Generally one earns money by many questionable means. Therefore at some time one should retire and distribute whatever one has to the brāhmaṇas and Vaiṣṇavas who engage in devotional service by preaching the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
