Just as Rāvaṇa, although born of a brāhmaṇa father, Viśvaśravā, was nevertheless called an asura or rākṣasa because of his offenses against Lord Rāmacandra (Viṣṇu) and Hanumān (a Vaiṣṇava), so Rāmacandra Khān also became such an asura because of his offenses against Haridāsa Ṭhākura and many others."
