In this way a devotee worships the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such worship is called yajña. Yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi sumedhasaḥ: those whose intelligence is brilliant accept this hari-nāma-yajña, the yajña of chanting the holy name of the Lord. By performing this yajña, one satisfies the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus attains perfection in spiritual life. According to external vision, Haridāsa Ṭhākura belonged to a Mohammedan family. Nevertheless, because he engaged himself in performing the yajña of chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra, he became a regularly initiated brāhmaṇa. As stated in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (3.33.6):"

It is further said in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (12.1.40):"

They will devour the citizens with their atheistic activities.\" A person who is not purified by the prescribed process of saṁskāra is called asaṁskṛta, but if one remains kriyā-hīna even after being purified by initiation-in other words, if one fails to actually apply the principles of purity in his life-he remains an unpurified mleccha or yavana. On the other hand, we find that Haridāsa Ṭhākura, although born in a mleccha or yavana family, became Nāmācārya Haridāsa Ṭhākura because he performed the nāma-yajña a minimum of 300,000 times every day."

Thus when the prostitute became restless, he informed her that first he had to finish his chanting and then he would be able to satisfy her. Actually Haridāsa Ṭhākura chanted the holy name of the Lord for three nights continuously and gave the prostitute a chance to hear him. Thus she became purified, as will be seen in the following verses."
