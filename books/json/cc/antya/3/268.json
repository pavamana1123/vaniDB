	"synonyms": "kṛṣṇa-ādi—beginning from Kṛṣṇa; āra—and; yata—ail; sthāvara-jaṅgame—moving and nonmoving creatures; kṛṣṇa-preme—in love of Kṛṣṇa; matta—maddened; kare—make; kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtane—chanting the holy name of Kṛṣṇa.",
	"translation": "The holy name of Kṛṣṇa is so attractive that anyone who chants it-including all living entities, moving and nonmoving, and even Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself-becomes imbued with love of Kṛṣṇa. This is the effect of chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra."
