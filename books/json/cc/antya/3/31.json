Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, however, wanted to inform her that actually it was not a dream. He actually came there and ate whatever His mother offered Him. Such are the dealings of advanced devotees with the Supreme personality of Godhead. As stated in the Brahma-saṁhitā:"

The Lord, however, talks with the advanced devotee, and the advanced devotee also sees Him. It is all factual; it is not a dream."
