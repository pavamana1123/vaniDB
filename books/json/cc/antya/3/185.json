	"synonyms": "aiche—similarly; nāma-udaya—of the appearance of the holy name; ārambhe—by the beginning; pāpa—reactions of sinful activities; ādira—of them and others; kṣaya—dissipation; udaya kaile—when there is actually awakening of offenseless chanting; kṛṣṇa-pade—at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa; haya prema-udaya—there is awakening of ecstatic love.",
	"translation": "\"Similarly, the first hint that offenseless chanting of the Lord's holy name has awakened dissipates the reactions of sinful life immediately. And when one chants the holy name offenselessly, one awakens to service in ecstatic love at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa."
