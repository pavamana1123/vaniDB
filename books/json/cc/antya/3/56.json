			"content": "This refers to an instance in which a meat-eater being killed by a boar uttered the words \"hā rāma, hā rāma\"again and again at the time of his death. Since this is a quotation from the Nṛsiṁha Purāṇa, this indicates that in the purāṇic age there must also have been mlecchas and yavanas (meateaters), and the words \"hā rāma,, meaning \"condemned,\" were also uttered in those days. Thus Haridāsa Ṭhākura gives evidence that even a meat-eater who condemns something by uttering the words \"hā rāma\" gets the benefit of chanting the holy name that the devotee chants to mean \"O my Lord Rāma.\""
