	"synonyms": "prabhura—of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu; yateka guṇa—all the transcendental attributes; sparśite nārila—could not touch or understand; chidra cāhi'-looking for faults; bule—he goes about; kāṅhā—anywhere; chidra—fault; nā pāila—he could not find.",
	"translation": "Because Rāmacandra Purī was interested only in finding faults, he could not understand the transcendental qualities of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. His only concern was finding faults, but still he could not find any."
