	"synonyms": "āpanāra karma-doṣa—it is the result of My own fate; tore—unto you; kibā—what; kari roṣa—I give accusations; toya-moya—between you and Me; sam-bandha—the relationship; vidūra—very far; ye—the one who is; āmāra—My; prāṇa-nātha—life and soul; ekatra—together; rahi—We remain; yāṅra sātha—with whom; sei kṛṣṇa—that Kṛṣṇa; ha-ilā niṭhura—has become so cruel.",
	"translation": "\"But this is the fault of My own destiny. Why should I needlessly accuse you? There is no intimate relationship between you and Me. Kṛṣṇa, however, is My life and soul. It is We who live together, and it is He who has become so cruel."
