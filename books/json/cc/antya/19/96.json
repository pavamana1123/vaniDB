	"translation": "\"The scent of Kṛṣṇa's transcendental body is so attractive that it enchants the bodies and minds of all women. It bewilders their nostrils, loosens their belts and hair, and makes them madwomen. All the women of world come under its influence, and therefore the scent of Kṛṣṇa's body is like a plunderer."
