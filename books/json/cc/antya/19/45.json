			"content": "This verse, quoted from Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (10.39.19), was chanted by the damsels of Vraja when Kṛṣṇa left Vṛndāvana for Mathurā with Akrūra and Balarāma. The gopīs lamented that providence had made it possible for them to meet Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma in affection and love and had then separated them."
