	"translation": "\"If a person's eyes even once capture that beautiful body of Kṛṣṇa's, it remains always prominent within his heart. Kṛṣṇa's body resembles the sap of the mango tree, for when it enters the minds of women, it will not come out, despite great endeavor. Thus Kṛṣṇa's extraordinary body is like a thorn of the seyā berry tree."
