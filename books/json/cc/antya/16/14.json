This village is situated about three miles south of the village of Kṛṣṇapura, the birthplace of Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī, which is about one mile west of the Byāṇḍel junction of the Burdwan line. A post office there is named Devānanda-pura. Jhaḍu Ṭhākura used to worship the Deity of Śrī Madana-gopāla. The Deity is still worshiped by one Rāmaprasāda dāsa, who belongs to the rāmāyet community. It is said that the Deity worshiped by Kālidāsa had been worshiped until now in the village of Śaṅkhya on the bank of the Sarasvatī River, but the Deity has been taken away by a gentleman named Matilāla Caṭṭopādhyāya from the village of Triveṇī. The Deity is now being worshiped at his place."
