	"translation": "\" 'This flute is utterly unfit because it is merely a dead bamboo stick. Moreover, it belongs to the male sex. Yet this flute is always drinking the nectar of Kṛṣṇa's lips, which surpasses nectarean sweetness of every description. Only in hope of that nectar do the gopīs continue to live."
