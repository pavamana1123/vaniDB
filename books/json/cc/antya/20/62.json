	"translation": "The pure devotional service in Vṛndāvana is like the golden particles in the River Jāmbū. In Vṛndāvana there is not a trace of personal sense gratification. It is to advertise such pure love in this material world that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has written the previous verse and explained its meaning."
