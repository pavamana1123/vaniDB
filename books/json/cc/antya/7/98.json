Therefore He would know the circumstances under which Paṇḍita Gosāñi agreed to hear Vallabha Bhaṭṭa's explanations, and certainly He would not be angry. However, the Vaiṣṇavas who were always with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu might not understand Gadādhara Paṇḍita's inner consciousness, and they might accuse him of having compromised with Vallabha Bhaṭṭa, despite his having been neglected by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Gadādhara Paṇḍita Gosāñi was seriously thinking in this way."
