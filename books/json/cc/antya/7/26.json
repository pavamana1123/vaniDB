	"translation": "\"There are two kinds of emotion [bhāva]. Emotion with an understanding of the Lord's full opulences is called aiśvarya-jñāna-yukta, and pure, uncontaminated emotion is called kevala. One cannot achieve shelter at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, the son of Mahārāja Nanda, simply by knowing His opulences.",
