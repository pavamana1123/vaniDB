	"synonyms": "trayyā—by followers of the three Vedas who perform great sacrifices like Indra and other demigods; ca—also; upaniṣadbhiḥ—by the followers of the Upaniṣads, the topmost portion of Vedic knowledge; ca—also; sāṅkhya—by the philosophers who analytically study the universe; yogaiḥ—by mystic yogīs; ca—and; sātvataiḥ—by devotees who follow the method of worship mentioned in the Pañcarātra and other Vedic literatures; upagīyamāna—being sung; māhātmyam—whose glories; harim—unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead; sā—she, mother Yaśodā; amanyata—considered; ātma-jam—her own son, born out of her body.",
	"translation": "\"When mother Yaśodā saw all the universes within the mouth of Kṛṣṇa, she was certainly astonished for the time being. Nevertheless, she still considered the Lord her own son, although He is worshiped by great personalities who offer him sacrifices, great saints who understand the greatness of the Lord by studying the Upaniṣads, great philosophers who analytically study the universe, great yogīs who know him as the all-pervading Supersoul, and even devotees who accept the Lord as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.'",
