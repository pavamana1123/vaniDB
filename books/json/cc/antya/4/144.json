			"content": "The words prabhu-datta deśa are very significant. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's devotional cult teaches one not to sit down in one place but to spread the devotional cult all over the world. The Lord dispatched Sanātana Gosvāmī and Rūpa Gosvāmī to Vṛndāvana to excavate and renovate the holy places and from there establish the cult of bhakti. Therefore Vṛndāvana was given to Sanātana Gosvāmī and Rūpa Gosvāmī as their place of residence. Similarly, everyone in the line of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's devotional cult should accept the words of the spiritual master and thus spread the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. They should go everywhere, to all parts of the world, accepting those places as prabhu-datta deśa, the places of residence given by the spiritual master or Lord Kṛṣṇa. The spiritual master is the representative of Lord Kṛṣṇa; therefore one who has carried out the orders of the spiritual master is understood to have carried out the orders of Kṛṣṇa or Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu wanted to spread the bhakti cult all over the world (pṛthivīte āche yata nagarādi grāma). Therefore devotees in the line of Kṛṣṇa consciousness must go to different parts of the world and preach, as ordered by the spiritual master. That will satisfy Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu."
