			"content": "\"When will Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī Prabhupāda, who has established within the material world the mission to fulfill the desire of Lord Caitanya, give me shelter under his lotus feet?\" Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī and Sanātana Gosvāmī were previously ministers directly in charge of the government of Nawab Hussain Shah, and they were also householders, but later they became gosvāmīs. A gosvāmī, therefore, is one who executes the will of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The title \"gosvāmī\" is not an inherited designation; it is meant for a person who has controlled his sense gratification and dedicated his life to executing the order of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Therefore Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī and Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī became genuine gosvāmīs after dedicating their lives to the service of the Lord."
