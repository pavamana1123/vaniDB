Because he always engages in the service of the Lord, his body is transcendental and full of spiritual bliss. His body should never be considered material, just as the body of the Deity worshiped in the temple is never considered to be made of stone or wood. Factually, the Deity is directly the Supreme Personality of Godhead, without a doubt. The injunctions of the Padma Purāṇa therefore state: arcye viṣṇau śilādhīr guruṣu nara-matir vaiṣṇave jāti-buddhiḥ. ..yasya vā nārakī saḥ. The Deity worshiped in the temple is never stone or wood. Similarly, the body of a Vaiṣṇava fully dedicated to the service of the Lord is never considered to belong to the material modes of nature."
