	"translation": "Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu always appeared in four places-in the household temple of mother Śacī, in the places where Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu danced, in the house of Śrīvāsa Paṇḍita during congregational chanting and in the house of Rāghava Paṇḍita. He appeared because of His attraction to the love of His devotees. That is His natural characteristic."
