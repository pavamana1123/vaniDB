	"synonyms": "ācārya-sambandhe—because he was related with Bhagavān Ācārya; bāhye—externally; kare—does; prīti-ābhāsa—appearance of pleasure; kṛṣṇa-bhakti—devotional service to Lord Kṛṣṇa; vinā—without; prabhura—of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu; nā haya—there is no; ullāsa—jubilation.",
	"translation": "Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu derives no happiness from meeting one who is not a pure devotee of Kṛṣṇa. Thus because Gopāla Bhaṭṭācārya was a Māyāvādī scholar, the Lord felt no jubilation in meeting him. Nevertheless, because Gopāla Bhaṭṭācārya was related to Bhagavān Ācārya, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu feigned pleasure in seeing him."
