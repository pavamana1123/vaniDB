	"translation": "Then all the devotees, headed by Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī, concluded that because Haridāsa had committed suicide at the confluence of the rivers Ganges and Yamunā, he must have ultimately attained shelter at the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.",

			"content": "Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura remarks that after one adopts the renounced order and accepts the dress of either a sannyāsī or a bābājī, if he entertains the idea of sense gratification, especially in relationship with a woman, the only atonement is to commit suicide in the confluence of the Ganges and Yamunā. Only by such atonement can his sinful life be purified. If such a person is thus punished, it is possible for him to attain the shelter of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Without such punishment, however, the shelter of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is very difficult to regain."
