Therefore to touch his body with one's feet or to climb the column of Garuḍa is certainly a vaiṣṇava-aparādha, an offense to a Vaiṣṇava. The woman was also offensive to Kṛṣṇa by putting her foot on the shoulder of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Seeing all these offenses, Govinda very hastily made her get down."
