	"synonyms": "unmattera prāya—as if mad; prabhu—Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu; karena—performs; gāna-nṛtya—singing and dancing; dehera—of the body; svabhāve—by nature; karena—carries out; snāna—bathing; bhojana—eating; kṛtya—duties.",
	"translation": "Thus Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu would chant and dance, always absorbed in the bliss of transcendental madness. He carried out the necessities of the body, such as eating and bathing, merely out of habit."
