	"translation": "After embracing Rāmānanda Rāya, the Lord pacified him, informing him, \"But for you, no one has ever seen this form.\"\n \nIn the Bhagavad-gītā (7.25) Lord Kṛṣṇa states:\n \nNEXTVERSE\nnāhaṁ prakāśaḥ sarvasyayoga-māyā-samāvṛtaḥmūḍho 'yaṁ nābhijānātiloko mām ajam avyayam\n \nNEXTVERSE\n\"I am never manifest to the foolish and unintelligent. For them I am covered by My internal potency [yogamāyā], and so they do not know Me, who am unborn and infallible.\"\n \nThe Lord always reserves the right of not being exposed to everyone. The devotees, however, are always engaged in the service of the Lord, serving with the tongue by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra and tasting mahā-prasāda. Gradually the sincere devotee pleases the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the Supreme Lord reveals Himself. One cannot see the Supreme Lord by making personal efforts. Rather, when the Lord is pleased by the service of a devotee, He reveals Himself."
