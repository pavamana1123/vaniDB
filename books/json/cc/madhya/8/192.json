Although this is factual, you can continue telling Me more if there is anything more to say.\" In reply, Rāmānanda Rāya said, \"I do not think I have anything to say beyond this, but there is a topic known as prema-vilāsa-vivarta, which I may explain to You. I do not know whether it will bring You happiness or not.\""
