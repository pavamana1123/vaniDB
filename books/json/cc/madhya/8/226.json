	"synonyms": "aṅghri-padma-sudhāya—by the nectar derived from the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa; kahe—it says; kṛṣṇa-saṅga-ānanda—transcendental bliss by the association of Kṛṣṇa; vidhi-mārge—on the path of regulative principles; nā pāiye—one does not get; vraje—in Goloka Vṛndāvana; kṛṣṇa-candra—Lord Kṛṣṇa.",
	"translation": "\"The word 'aṅghri-padma-sudhā' means 'associating intimately with Kṛṣṇa.' One can attain such perfection only by spontaneous love of God. One cannot obtain Kṛṣṇa in Goloka Vṛndāvana simply by serving the Lord according to regulative principles."
