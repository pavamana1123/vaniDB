	"synonyms": "ei ta'-this indeed; sannyāsīra—of the sannyāsī, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu; teja—bodily effulgence; dekhi—we see; brahma-sama—exactly like Brahman; śūdre—a śūdra, or worker; āliṅgiyā—embracing; kene—why; karena—does; krandana—crying.",
	"translation": "These brāhmaṇas began to think, \"We can see that this sannyāsī has a luster like the effulgence of Brahman, but how is it He is crying upon embracing a śūdra, a member of the fourth caste in the social order?\""
