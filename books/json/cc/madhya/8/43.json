The measurement of His chest and the measurement of His forearms were the same length. This is called nyagrodha-parimaṇḍala. As far as His nature is concerned, He was kind to everyone. No one but the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be kind to everyone. Therefore the Lord's name is Kṛṣṇa, \"all-attractive.\" As stated in the Bhagavad-gītā (14.4), Kṛṣṇa is kind to everyone. In every species of life (sarva-yoniṣu), He is the original father, the seed-giver (bīja-pradaḥ pitā). How, then, can He be unkind to any living entity? One may be a man, an animal or even a tree, but the Lord is kind to everyone. That is God's qualification. He also says in the Bhagavad-gītā (9.29), samo 'ham sarva-bhūteṣu: the Lord is equally kind to everyone. And He advises, sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja. This instruction is meant not only for Arjuna but for all living entities. Whoever takes advantage of this offer is immediately immune to all sinful activity and returns home, back to Godhead. While present on this planet, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu made the same offer."
