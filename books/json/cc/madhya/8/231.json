	"synonyms": "tāhāte—in that; dṛṣṭānta—the evidence; lakṣmī—the goddess of fortune; karila—did; bhajana—worship; tathāpi—still; nā—not; pāila—got; vraje—in Vṛndāvana; vrajendra-nandana—the son of Mahārāja Nanda, Kṛṣṇa.",
	"translation": "\"The unspoken example in this connection is the goddess of fortune, who worshiped Lord Kṛṣṇa in order to attain His pastimes in Vṛndāvana. But due to her opulent life-style, she could not attain the service of Kṛṣṇa in Vṛndāvana."
