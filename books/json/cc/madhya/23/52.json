	"translation": "\"There are other ingredients beginning with complete despondency and jubilation. Altogether there are thirty-three varieties, and when these combine, the mellow becomes very wonderful.\n \nNirveda, harṣa, and other symptoms are explained in Madhya-līlā (14.167). The transitory elements (vyabhicārī) are described in the Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu as follows:\n \nNEXTVERSE\nathocyante trayas triṁśad-bhāvā ye vyabhicāriṇaḥviśeṣeṇābhimukhyenacaranti sthāyinaṁ prativāg-aṅga-sattva-sūcyā yejñeyās te vyabhicāriṇaḥ\n \nNEXTVERSE\nsañcārayanti bhāvasyagatiṁ sañcāriṇo 'pi teunmajjanti nimajjantistāyiny-amṛta-vāridhauūrmivad vardhayanty enaṁyānti tad-rūpatāṁ ca te\n \nNEXTVERSE\nThere are thirty-three transitory elements known as vyabhicārī-ecstatic emotions. They especially wander about the permanent sentiments as assistants. They are to be known by words, by different symptoms seen in the limbs and in other parts of the body, and by the peculiar conditions of the heart. Because they set in motion the progress of the permanent sentiments, they are specifically called sañcārī, or impelling principles. These impelling principles rise up and fall back in the permanent sentiments of ecstatic love like waves in an ocean of ecstasy. Consequently they are called vyabhicāri."
