	"translation": "\"Not a moment should be lost. Every moment should be utilized for Kṛṣṇa or connected with Him.\n \nPUPORT\n \nMahārāja Parīkṣit's expression of anxiety is explained in this verse. He says, \"Let whatever is destined to happen take place. It doesn't matter. Just let me see that not a moment of my time is wasted without a relationship with Kṛṣṇa.\" One has to tolerate all obstacles on the path of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and one has to see that not a moment of his life is wasted outside of Kṛṣṇa's service."
