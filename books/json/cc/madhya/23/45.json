	"translation": "\"According to the candidate possessing these transcendental qualities [sneha, māna and so on], there are five transcendental mellows-neutrality, servitorship, friendship, parental love and conjugal love.\n \nIn the Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu, rati (attraction) is thus described:\n \nNEXTVERSE\nvyaktaṁ masṛṇitevāntar-lakṣyate rati-lakṣaṇammumukṣu-prabhṛtīnaṁ cedbhaved eṣā ratir na hi\n \nNEXTVERSE\nkintu bāla-camatkāra-kārī tac-cihna-vīkṣayāabhijñena subodho 'yaṁraty-ābhāsaḥ prakīrtitaḥ\n \nNEXTVERSE\nThe real symptoms of the fructification of the seed of love (rati) are manifest because the heart is melted. When such symptoms are found among speculators and fruitive actors, they cannot be accepted as real symptoms of attachment. Foolish people without knowledge of devotional service praise such symptoms of attachment even when they are based on something other than a desire to serve Kṛṣṇa. However, one who is expert in devotional service calls such symptoms rati-ābhāsa, a mere glimpse of attachment."
