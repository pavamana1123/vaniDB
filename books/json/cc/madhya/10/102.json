			"content": "\"Svarūpa\" is one of the names of a brahmacārī in Śaṅkarācārya's disciplic succession. In the Vedic discipline there are ten names for sannyāsīs, and it is customary for a brahmacārī assisting a sannyāsī of the designation Tīrtha or Āśrama to receive the title Svarūpa. Dāmodara Svarūpa was formerly a resident of Navadvīpa, and his name was Puruṣottama Ācārya. When he went to Vārāṇasī, he took sannyāsa from a sannyāsī designated Tīrtha. Although he received the title Svarūpa in his brahmacārī stage, he did not change his name when he took sannyāsa. Actually as a sannyāsī he should have been called Tīrtha, but he chose to retain his original brahmacārī title as Svarūpa."
