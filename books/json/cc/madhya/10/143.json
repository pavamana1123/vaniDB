No one should disrespect his Godbrother or try to engage him as a servant. For this reason Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu asked Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya what to do about Govinda. Govinda was the personal servant of Īśvara Purī, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's spiritual master, and now Īśvara Purī had ordered Govinda to become Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's personal servant. So what was to be done? This was the inquiry Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu placed before Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, an experienced friend."
