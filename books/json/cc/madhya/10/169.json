This is confirmed in the Vedas: nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is Brahman or Paraṁbrahman, the chief of all living entities. Both the Supreme Brahman, or the Personality of Godhead, and the living entities are persons, but the Supreme Brahman is the predominator, whereas the living entities are predominated."
