	"synonyms": "guru-śiṣya-nyāye—when there is a logical argument between the spiritual master and the disciple; satya—certainly; śiṣyera—of the disciple; parājaya—defeat; bhāratī kahe—Brahmānanda Bhāratī said; eho nahe—in this case it is not the fact; anya hetu—another cause; haya—there is.",
	"translation": "Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu thus posed Himself as a disciple and accepted Brahmānanda Bhāratī as His spiritual master. He then said, \"The disciple is certainly defeated in an argument with the spiritual master.\"\n \nBrahmānanda Bhāratī immediately countered these words, saying, \"This is not the cause of Your defeat. There is another cause."
