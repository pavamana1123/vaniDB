On the other hand, Brahmānanda Bhāratī also wanted to prove that Jagannātha and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu are one, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but that to fulfill His mission Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu appeared to be moving whereas Lord Jagannātha appeared to be inert. Thus this jolly argument was going on. Finally, Brahmānanda Bhāratī referred the whole matter to Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya for a final decision."
