	"synonyms": "sannyāsī—a person in the renounced order of life; cit-kaṇa jīva—a small fragmental living being; kiraṇa—of sunshine; kaṇa—small particle; sama—like; ṣaṭ-aiśvarya-pūrṇa—full in six opulences; kṛṣṇa—Lord Kṛṣṇa; haya—is; sūrya-upama—compared to the sun.",
	"translation": "\"A sannyāsī in the renounced order is certainly part and parcel of the complete whole, just as a shining molecular particle of sunshine is part and parcel of the sun itself. Kṛṣṇa is like the sun, full of six opulences, but the living entity is only a fragment of the complete whole."
