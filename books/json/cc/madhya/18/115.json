			"content": "Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura says that the word pāṣaṇḍī refers to one who considers the living entity under the control of the illusory energy to be equal with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is transcendental to all material qualities. Another kind of pāṣaṇḍī is one who does not believe in the spirit soul, the superior potency of the Lord, and therefore does not distinguish between spirit and matter. While describing one of the offenses against chanting the holy names, an offense called śruti-śāstra-nindana (blaspheming the Vedic literature), Jīva Gosvāmī states in his Bhakti-sandarbha: yathā pāṣaṇḍa-mārgeṇa dattātreyarṣabha-devopāsakānāṁ pāṣaṇḍīnām. Worshipers of impersonalists like Dattātreya are also pāṣaṇḍīs. Concerning the offense of ahaṁ-mama-buddhi, or dehātma-buddhi (considering the body to be the self), Jīva Gosvāmī states: deva-draviṇādi-nimittaka-'pāṣaṇḍa'-śabdena ca daśāparādhā eva lakṣyante, pāṣaṇḍamayatvāt teṣām. \"Those who are overly absorbed in the conception of the body and the bodily necessities are also called pāṣaṇḍīs.\" Elsewhere in Bhakti-sandarbha it is stated:"

The word pāṣaṇḍī has been described in many places in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, including 4.2.28, 30, 32; 5.6.9 and 12.2.13, 43."
