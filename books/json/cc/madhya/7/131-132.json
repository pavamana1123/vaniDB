	"translation": "While on His tour, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu would spend the night at a temple or on the roadside. Whenever He accepted food from a person, He would give him the same advice He gave the brāhmaṇa named Kūrma. He adopted this process until He returned from His South Indian tour to Jagannātha Purī."
