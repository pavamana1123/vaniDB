	"translation": "Although Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was thinking that the quantity of food was enormous, Nityānanda Prabhu, on the contrary, thought it not even a morsel. He had been fasting for three days and had greatly hoped to break fast on that day. Indeed, He said, \"Although I am invited to eat by Advaita Ācārya, today also is a fast. So small a quantity of food will not even fill half My belly.\""
