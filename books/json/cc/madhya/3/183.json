	"translation": "\"Since Jagannātha Purī and Navadvīpa are intimately related-as if they were two rooms in the same house-people from Navadvīpa generally go to Jagannātha Purī, and those in Jagannātha Purī go to Navadvīpa. This going and coming will help carry news of Lord Caitanya. In this way I will be able to get news of Him."
