	"synonyms": "nīlācale—at Jagannātha Purī; navadvīpe—as well as Navadvīpa; yena—as if; dui—two; ghara—rooms; loka—people; gatāgati—come and go; vārtā—news; pāba—I shall get; nirantara—always.",
	"translation": "\"Since Jagannātha Purī and Navadvīpa are intimately related-as if they were two rooms in the same house-people from Navadvīpa generally go to Jagannātha Purī, and those in Jagannātha Purī go to Navadvīpa. This going and coming will help carry news of Lord Caitanya. In this way I will be able to get news of Him."
