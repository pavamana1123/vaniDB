	"synonyms": "eta bali'-saying this; cale prabhu—the Lord began to proceed; prema-unmādera cihna—the symptoms of ecstatic love; dik-vidik-jñāna—knowledge of the right direction or wrong direction; nāhi—there is not; kibā—whether; rātri-dina—night or day.",
	"translation": "As Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was enroute to Vṛndāvana, all the ecstatic symptoms became manifest, and He did not know in which direction He was going, nor did He know whether it was day or night."
