			"content": "When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu formerly went to South India, a brāhmaṇa named Kālā Kṛṣṇadāsa went with Him. It was Kālā Kṛṣṇadāsa who fell victim to a woman, and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu had to take the trouble to free him from the clutches of the gypsies. Therefore the Lord here says that He wants a new man who is peaceful in mind. One whose mind is not peaceful is agitated by certain drives, especially sex desire, even though he be in the company of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Such a man will become a victim of women and will fall down even in the company of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Māyā is so strong that unless one is determined not to fall victim, even the Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot give protection. The Supreme Lord and His representative always want to give protection, but a person must take advantage of their personal contact. If one thinks that the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His representative is an ordinary man, he will certainly fall down. Thus Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu did not want a person like Kālā Kṛṣṇadāsa to accompany Him. He wanted someone who was determined, who had a peaceful mind and who was not agitated by ulterior motives."
