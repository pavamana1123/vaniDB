As long as the living entity is conditioned by the three modes of material nature-(goodness, passion and ignorance)-the objects of his material senses-material form, taste, smell, sound and touch-will not help him understand spiritual knowledge and bliss. Rather, these are revealed to the pure devotee. One's material name, form and qualities are certainly different from one another. In the material world, there is no conception of absolute; however, when we come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness we find that there is no material difference between Kṛṣṇa's body and His names, activities and entourage."
