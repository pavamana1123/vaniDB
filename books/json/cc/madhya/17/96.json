			"content": "The six philosophical treatises are: (1) vaiśeṣika, propounded by Kaṇāda Ṛṣi, (2) nyāya, propounded by Gautama Ṛṣi, (3) yoga or mysticism, propounded by Patañjali Ṛṣi, (4) the philosophy of sāṅkhya, propounded by Kapila Ṛṣi, (5) the philosophy of karma-mīmāṁsā, propounded by Jaimini Ṛṣi, and (6) the philosophy of brahma-mīmāṁsā, or Vedānta, the ultimate conclusion of the Absolute Truth (janmādy asya yataḥ), propounded by Vedavyāsa. Actually Vedānta philosophy is meant for the devotees because in Bhagavad-gītā Lord Kṛṣṇa says, vedānta-kṛd veda-vid eva cāham: \"I am the compiler of Vedānta, and I am the knower of the Vedas.\" (Bg. 15.15) Vyāsadeva is an incarnation of Kṛṣṇa, and consequently Kṛṣṇa is the compiler of Vedānta philosophy. Therefore Kṛṣṇa clearly knows the purport of Vedānta philosophy. As stated in Bhagavad-gītā, whoever hears Vedānta philosophy from Kṛṣṇa is actually aware of the real meaning of Vedānta. The Māyāvādīs who have called themselves Vedāntists do not at all understand the purport of Vedānta philosophy. Not being properly educated, people in general think that Vedānta means the Śaṅkarite interpretation."
