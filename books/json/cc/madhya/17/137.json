Being situated in the spiritual world is certainly pleasurable, but those who realize the transcendental name, form, qualities and pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa enjoy transcendental bliss many times more than one who has simply realized the self. When one is situated on the platform of self-realization, he can certainly be easily attracted by Kṛṣṇa and become a servant of the Lord. This is explained in Bhagavad-gītā:"

One who has attained this platform is not agitated by material action and reaction. He sees everyone on the platform of spirit soul (paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ). When one is completely realized, he can rise to the platform of pure devotional service (mad-bhaktiṁ-labhate parām). When one comes to the platform of bhakti, devotional service, he automatically realizes who Kṛṣṇa is."
