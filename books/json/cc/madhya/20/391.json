	"translation": "\"Just like the sun, there is an orbit to Kṛṣṇa's pastimes, which are manifest one after the other. During the lifetime of fourteen Manus, this orbit expands through all the universes, and gradually it returns. Thus Kṛṣṇa moves with His pastimes through all the universes, one after another."
