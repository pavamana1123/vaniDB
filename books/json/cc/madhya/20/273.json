The glancing is performed by Mahā-Viṣṇu: sa aikṣata lokān nu sṛjā iti (Aitareya Upaniṣad 1.1.1). In the conditional stage we impregnate according to the bodily conception-that is, by sexual intercourse-but the Supreme Lord does not need sexual intercourse to impregnate. The impregnation is performed simply by His glance. This is also explained in the Brahma-saṁhitā (5.32):"

			"type": "normal",
			"content": "The word svāṅga-viśeṣābhāsa-rūpe, the form by which the Lord begets living entities in the material world, is explained herein. He is Lord Śiva. In the Brahma-saṁhitā it is stated that Lord Śiva, who is another form of Mahā-Viṣṇu, is like yogurt. Yogurt is nothing but milk, yet it is not milk. Similarly, Lord Śiva is considered the father of this universe, and material nature is considered the mother. The father and mother are known as Lord Śiva and the goddess Durgā. Together, Lord Śiva's genitals and the vagina of goddess Durgā are worshiped as śiva-liṅga. This is the origin of the material creation. Thus Lord Śiva's position is between the living entity and the Supreme Lord. Lord Śiva is neither the Supreme Personality of Godhead nor the living entity. He is the form through which the Supreme Lord works to beget living entities within this material world. As yogurt is prepared when milk is mixed with a culture, the form of Lord Śiva expands when the Supreme Personality of Godhead is in touch with material nature. The impregnation of material nature by the father, Lord Śiva, is wonderful because at one time innumerable living entities are conceived. Bhāgo jīvaḥ sa vijñeyaḥ sa cānantyāya kalpate (Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad 5.9). These living entities are very, very small."

This is the process of material creation. Without the living entity, this material nature has no value. Both emanate from the pores of the transcendental body of Lord Mahā-Viṣṇu. They are different energies. That is explained in Bhagavad-gītā:"

All these things are very clearly explained in the Vedas. The materialistic theory that life develops from matter is incorrect. Life and matter come from the supreme living entity; therefore, being the source of both, that supreme living entity, Kṛṣṇa, is described in Vedānta-sūtra as janmādy asya yataḥ (1.1), or the original source of everything, sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam. This is further explained in the following verse."
