The London daily newspaper the Guardian published a front-page photo caption: \"ISKCON Ratha-yātrā is rival to the Nelson Column in Trafalgar Square.\" The Nelson Column is a very impressive statue of Lord Nelson and can be seen from a good distance. Just as the residents of Purī compared the Ratha-yātrā car to Mount Sumeru, the residents of London considered the car rival to the Nelson Monument."
