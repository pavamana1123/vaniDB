			"content": "As Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was playing the part of a world teacher, He did not agree to see the King because a king is a mundane person interested in money and women. Indeed, the very name \"king\" suggests one who is always surrounded by money and women. As a sannyāsī, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was afraid of both money and women. The very word \"king\" is repugnant to one who is in the renounced order of life. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu refused to see the King, but indirectly, by the Lord's causeless mercy, the King was able to understand the Lord's mysterious activities. Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu's activities were exhibited sometimes to reveal Him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and sometimes to show Him as a devotee. Both kinds of activity are mysterious and appreciated only by pure devotees."
