It is a song of separation from Kṛṣṇa. When Rādhārāṇī met Kṛṣṇa at Kurukṣetra, She remembered His intimate association in Vṛndāvana, and She thought, \"Now I have gained the Lord of my life. In His absence I was being burned by the arrow of Cupid, and thus I was withering away. Now I have My life again.\""
