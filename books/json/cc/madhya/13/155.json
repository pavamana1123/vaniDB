When Kṛṣṇa is not manifest before the inhabitants of Vṛndāvana, they are always absorbed in thoughts of Him. Therefore even though Kṛṣṇa was living at that time at Dvārakā, He was simultaneously present before all the inhabitants of Vṛndāvana. This was His aprakaṭa presence. Devotees who are always absorbed in thoughts of Kṛṣṇa will soon see Kṛṣṇa face to face without a doubt. Devotees who are always engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and are fully absorbed in thoughts of Kṛṣṇa certainly return home, back to Godhead. They then see Kṛṣṇa directly, face to face, take prasāda with Him and enjoy His company. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gītā: tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti so 'rjuna (Bg. 4.9)."

He then meets Kṛṣṇa directly. This is successful human life. This is the meaning of prakaṭeha ānibe satvara. The pure devotee will soon see the personal manifestation of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa."
