In the beginning, however, they were unsuccessful. When they could not enter the dance simply by thinking of Kṛṣṇa in the ecstasy of the gopīs, they actually accepted bodies like those of the gopīs. They even took birth in Vrajabhūmi just like the gopīs and consequently became engrossed in the ecstasy of the gopīs' love. In this way they were allowed to enter into the rāsa-līlā dance of the Lord."
