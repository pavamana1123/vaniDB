The mountain chain begins along the bank of the river Tuṅgabhadrā, which gradually reaches the state of Hyderabad. According to other opinions, this hill is situated in Madhya Pradesh and bears the present name of Rāmpa. Daṇḍakāraṇya is a spacious tract of land which begins north of Khāndeśa and extends south to Ahmadnagar, west to Nāsika, and east to Aurangabad. The Godāvarī River flows through this tract of land, and there is a great forest there where Lord Rāmacandra lived."
