Sometimes it is said that the Kūrma Purāṇa contains six thousand verses, but originally the Kūrma Purāṇa contained seventeen thousand verses. According to Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, there are seventeen thousand verses in the Kūrma Purāṇa, which is one of the eighteen Mahā-purāṇas. The Kūrma Purāṇa is considered the fifteenth of these Mahā-purāṇas."
