	"translation": "There is no scripture equal to the Brahma-saṁhitā as far as the final spiritual conclusion is concerned. Indeed, that scripture is the supreme revelation of the glories of Lord Govinda, for it reveals the topmost knowledge about Him. Since all conclusions are briefly presented in the Brahma-saṁhitā, it is essential among all the Vaiṣṇava scriptures.",

			"content": "The Brahma-saṁhitā is a very important scripture. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu acquired the Fifth Chapter from the Ādi-keśava temple. In that Fifth Chapter, the philosophical conclusion of acintya-bhedābheda-tattva (simultaneous oneness and difference) is presented. The chapter also presents methods of devotional service; the eighteen-syllable Vedic hymn; discourses on the soul, the Supersoul and fruitive activity; an explanation of Kāma-gāyatrī, kāma-bīja and the original Mahā-Viṣṇu; and a detailed description of the spiritual world, specifically Goloka Vṛndāvana. Brahma-saṁhitā also explains the demigod Gaṇeśa; Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu; the origin of the Gāyatrī mantra; the form of Govinda and His transcendental position and abode; the living entities; the highest goal; the goddess Durgā; the meaning of austerity; the five gross elements; love of Godhead; impersonal Brahman; the initiation of Lord Brahmā; and the vision of transcendental love enabling one to see the Lord. The steps of devotional service are also explained. The mind; yoga-nidrā; the goddess of fortune; devotional service in spontaneous ecstasy; incarnations beginning with Lord Rāmacandra; Deities; the conditioned soul and its duties; the truth about Lord Viṣṇu; prayers; Vedic hymns; Lord Śiva; the Vedic literature; personalism and impersonalism; good behavior; and many other subjects are also discussed. There is also a description of the sun and the universal form of the Lord. All these subjects are conclusively explained in a nutshell in the Brahma-saṁhitā."
