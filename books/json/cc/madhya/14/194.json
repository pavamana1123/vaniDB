	"translation": "\" 'When Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī was decorated with the ornament of lalita-alaṅkāra, just to increase Śrī Kṛṣṇa's love, an attractive curve was manifest by Her neck, knees and waist. This was brought about by Her timidity and apparent desire to avoid Kṛṣṇa. The flickering movements of Her eyebrows could conquer the powerful bow of Cupid. To increase the joy of Her beloved's love, Her body was decorated with the ornaments of lalita-alaṅkāra.'",
