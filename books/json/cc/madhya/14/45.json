On whatever platform one may be situated, one is tossed by the waves of material nature. Someone may be rich, someone may be middle class, and someone may be a poor beggar-it doesn't matter. As long as one is under the spell of the three modes of material nature, he must continue to experience these divisions."

That is the verdict of the Bhagavad-gītā (14.26):"
