Then all sufferings would stop.\" Kṛṣṇa conducts the material world under the three modes of material nature, and consequently there are three platforms of life-higher, middle and lower. On whatever platform one may be situated, one is tossed by the waves of material nature. Someone may be rich, someone may be middle class, and someone may be a poor beggar-it doesn't matter. As long as one is under the spell of the three modes of material nature, he must continue to experience these divisions."

This is the only solution, regardless of social position. Everyone is suffering under the spell of māyā; therefore the best course is to learn how to get out of the clutches of māyā. That is the verdict of the Bhagavad-gītā (14.26):"
