	"translation": "When Rāmānanda Rāya addressed Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Caitanya Mahāprabhu objected, saying, \"I am not the Supreme Personality of Godhead but an ordinary human being. Therefore I must fear public opinion in three ways-with My body, mind and words."
