			"content": "Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is naturally the reservoir of all kindness, and as soon as He heard the statement made by the King, His heart immediately softened. Thus the Lord was ready to go see the King even at Kaṭaka. He did not even consider allowing the King to come from Kaṭaka to Jagannātha Purī to see Him. It is significant that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was so kind that He was ready to go see the King at Kaṭaka. Apparently it was never expected that the King wanted to see the Lord at His place, but by way of being externally harsh, the Lord indicated that if all the devotees so desired, He would go to Kaṭaka to see the King."
