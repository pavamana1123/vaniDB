The Lord took sannyāsa from Keśava Bhāratī in the Bhāratī sampradāya, in which the brahmacārīs (the assistants of the sannyāsīs) are named \"Caitanya.\" Even after accepting sannyāsa, Caitanya Mahāprabhu retained the name \"Caitanya,\" meaning a humble servant of a sannyāsī. Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya appreciated this very much."
