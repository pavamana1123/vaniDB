This prediction was now fulfilled. The Bhaṭṭācārya was fully converted to the cult of Vaiṣṇavism, and he was following the principles automatically, without being pressured. in the Bhagavad-gītā (2.40) it is therefore said, svalpam apy asya dharmasya trāyate mahato bhayāt: \"Simply by performing a little devotional service, one can escape the greatest danger.\" Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya had been in the greatest danger because he had adhered to Māyāvāda philosophy. Somehow or other he came into contact with Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and became a perfect devotee. In this way he was saved from the great falldown of impersonalism."
