Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam is divided into twelve cantos, and in the Ninth Canto different kinds of mukti are described. But the Tenth Canto is the actual center of all discussions of mukti because the Personality of Godhead Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who is the tenth subject discussed in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, is the exclusive subject of the Tenth Canto. Since all types of muktis reside at the lotus feet of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, He may be called mukti-pada."
