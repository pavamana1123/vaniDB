In other words, it is to be understood that devotees are already freed from sin. A sinful person, a miscreant (duṣkṛtī, cannot engage in devotional service. Nor can one engage in devotional service simply on the basis of scholarly speculation. One has to wait for the mercy of the Lord in order to render pure devotional service."
