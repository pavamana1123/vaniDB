			"content": "According to Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, among sannyāsīs the cultivation of Vedānta philosophy helps in becoming detached from sense gratification. Thus a sannyāsī can protect the prestige of wearing a loincloth (kaupīna). One has to practice sense control as well as mind control and subdue the six forces of speech, mind, anger, tongue, belly and genitals. Then one can become expert in understanding the devotional service of the Lord and thus become a perfect sannyāsī. For that purpose one must cultivate knowledge and renunciation regularly. When one is attached to material sense gratification, he cannot protect his sannyāsa order. Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya suggested that by the study of vairāgya (renunciation) Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu might be saved from the clutches of full-fledged youthful desires."
