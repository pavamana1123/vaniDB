			"content": "The words mahāprabhura mukhe, \"from the mouth of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu,\" are significant because Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu first heard the story of Mādhavendra Purī from His spiritual master, Śrīpāda Īśvara Purī. For this story refer to Madhya-līlā, Chapter Four, verse eighteen. After staying at Śrī Advaita's house in Śāntipura for some time, the Lord narrated the story of Mādhavendra Purī to Nityānanda Prabhu, Jagadānanda Prabhu, Dāmodara Paṇḍita and Mukunda dāsa. When they went to Remuṇā to the temple of Gopīnātha, He described Mādhavendra Purī's installation of the Gopāla Deity as well as Gopīnātha's stealing condensed milk. Due to this incident, Lord Gopīnātha became well known as Kṣīracorā, the thief who stole condensed milk."
