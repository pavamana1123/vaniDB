	"translation": "The Mohammedan governor accompanied Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu past Mantreśvara. This place was very dangerous due to pirates. He took the Lord to a place named Pichaldā, which was near Mantreśvara.\n \nThe very wide mouth of the Ganges near present-day Diamond Harbor was called Mantreśvara. Through the Ganges, the boat entered the Rūpa-nārāyaṇa River and reached the village of Pichaldā. Pichaldā and Mantreśvara are located very close together. After passing Mantreśvara, the Mohammedan governor accompanied the Lord as far as Pichaldā."
