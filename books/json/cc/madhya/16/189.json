			"content": "By chanting the holy names Kṛṣṇa and Hari, one is certainly liberated from sinful activities, such as killing cows or insulting brāhmaṇas and Vaiṣṇavas. It is most sinful to kill cows and insult brāhmaṇas and Vaiṣṇavas. The karma incurred by such activity is very great, but one can immediately nullify all this karma by surrendering to Lord Kṛṣṇa and chanting His holy name. After being released from one's sinful reactions (karma), one becomes eager to serve the Lord. This is the test. Since the Mohammedan governor was immediately purified in the presence of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he could utter the names of Kṛṣṇa and Hari. Consequently he was anxious to render some service, and the Lord, anxious to fulfill his desires, immediately had the devotee Mukunda Datta inform the governor that there was some service to render."
