	"synonyms": "mṛga-mada—the fragrance of musk; nīla-utpala—and the bluish lotus flower; milane—in mixing; ye—that; parimala—fragrance; yei—which; hare—vanquishes; tāra—of them; garva—pride; māna—and prestige; hena—such; kṛṣṇa—of Lord Kṛṣṇa; aṅga—of the body; gandha—the aroma; yāra—whose; nāhi—not; se—that; sambandha—relationship; sei—such; nāsā—nose; bhastrāra—to the bellows; samāna—equal.",
	"translation": "\"One's nostrils are no better than the bellows of a blacksmith if he has not smelled the fragrance of Kṛṣṇa's body, which is like the aroma of musk combined with that of the bluish lotus flower. Indeed, such combinations are actually defeated by the aroma of Kṛṣṇa's body."
