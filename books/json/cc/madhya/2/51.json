	"synonyms": "ei—this; premā—love of Kṛṣṇa; āsvādana—tasting; tapta—hot; ikṣu-carvaṇa—chewing sugarcane; mukha jvale—the mouth burns; nā yāya tyajana—still not possible to give up; sei—that; premā—love of Godhead; yāṅra mane—in someone's mind; tāra—of that; vikrama—the power; sei jāne—he knows; viṣa-amṛte—poison and nectar; ekatra—in oneness; milana—meeting.",
	"translation": "If one tastes such love of Godhead, he can compare it to hot sugarcane. When one chews hot sugarcane, his mouth burns, yet he cannot give it up. Similarly, if one has but a little love of Godhead, he can perceive its powerful effects. It can only be compared to poison and nectar mixed together."
