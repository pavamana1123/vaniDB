	"translation": "As the spiritual master chastises the disciple and teaches him the art of devotional service, so all the ecstatic symptoms of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu-including despondency, moroseness, humility, restlessness, joy, endurance and anger-all instructed His body and mind. In this way, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu passed His time."
