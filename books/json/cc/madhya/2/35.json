This sense of condemnation is described as dīnatā, humility. When one is subjected to such humility, he feels physically inactive, he apologizes, and his consciousness is disturbed. His mind is also restless, and many other symptoms are visible.\"1.\n Can you look this quote up and see if it ends where we indicate?\n(1) The word nirveda is also explained in the Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu: \"One may feel unhappiness and separation, as well as jealousy and lamentation, due to not discharging one's duties. The despondency that results is called nirveda. When one is captured by this despondency, thoughts, tears, loss of bodily luster, humility and heavy breathing result.\" Viṣāda is also explained in the Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu: \"When one fails to achieve his desired goal of life and repents for all his offenses, there is a state of regret called viṣāda.\" The symptoms of avasāda are also explained: \"One hankers to revive his original condition and inquires how to do so. There are also deep thought, heavy breathing, crying and lamentation, as well as a changing of the bodily color and drying up of the tongue.\""
