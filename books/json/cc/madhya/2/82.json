	"synonyms": "ei—this; gupta—confidential; bhāva-sindhu—ocean of ecstasies; brahmā—Lord Brahmā; nā—does not; pāya—get; eka—one; bindu—drop; hena—such; dhana—wealth; vilāila—distributed; saṁsāre—all over the world; aiche—such; dayālu—merciful; avatāra—incarnation; aiche—such; dātā—charitable donor; nāhi—there is not; āra—anyone else; guṇa—this quality; keha—anyone; nāre—not able; varṇibāre—to describe.",
	"translation": "No one, not even Lord Brahmā, can ascertain or even taste a drop of this confidential ocean of ecstasy, but Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, out of His causeless mercy, has distributed this love of Godhead all over the world. Thus there cannot be any incarnation more munificent than Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. There is no greater donor. Who can describe His transcendental qualities?"
