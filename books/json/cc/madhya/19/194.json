	"synonyms": "aiśvarya-jñāna-prādhānye—in the predominance of awe and veneration; saṅkucita—crippled; prīti—love; dekhiyā—seeing; nā māne—does not care; aiśvarya—opulence; kevalāra rīti—that is the symptom of pure devotional service.",
	"translation": "\"When opulence is very prominent, love of Godhead is somewhat crippled. According to kevalā devotion, however, even though the devotee sees the unlimited potency of Kṛṣṇa, he considers himself equal with Him."
