	"synonyms": "vṛndāvanīyām—related to Vṛndāvana; rasa-keli-vārtām—talks about the pastimes of Śrī Kṛṣṇa; kālena—with the course of time; luptām—lost; nija-śaktim—His personal potency; utkaḥ—being eager; sañcārya—infusing; rūpe—to Rūpa Gosvāmī; vyatanot—manifested; punaḥ—again; saḥ—He; prabhuḥ—Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu; vidhau—unto Lord Brahmā; prāk iva—as formerly; loka-sṛṣṭim—the creation of this cosmic manifestation.",
	"translation": "Before the creation of this cosmic manifestation, the Lord enlightened the heart of Lord Brahmā with the details of the creation and manifested the Vedic knowledge. In exactly the same way, the Lord, being anxious to revive the Vṛndāvana pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa, impregnated the heart of Rūpa Gosvāmī with spiritual potency. By this potency, Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī could revive the activities of Kṛṣṇa in Vṛndāvana, activities almost lost to memory. In this way, He spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness throughout the world."
