You know everything about our desires. We have only come because we are attracted by Your supremely musical flute. However, You are a great cheater. Who else would give up the company of young girls like us in the dead of night?'",

			"content": "This verse, quoted from Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (10.31.16), describes how the gopīs exposed themselves for Kṛṣṇa's enjoyment in the dead of night. The gopīs approached Kṛṣṇa to enjoy themselves with Him in the rāsa dance. Kṛṣṇa knew this very well, but He was superficially trying to avoid them. He is therefore addressed by the gopīs as kitava, a great cheater, because He first attracted them to come dance with Him, and yet when they actually came, neglecting the orders of their friends and relatives, He tried to avoid them by giving them good instructions. These cunning instructions were too much for the gopīs to tolerate; they therefore had a right to address Kṛṣṇa as kitava, a great cheater. They were all young girls, and they had come to Him to be enjoyed. How could He avoid them? The gopīs therefore expressed great disappointment in this verse. They came voluntarily, but Kṛṣṇa was so cunning that He wanted to avoid their company. The gopīs' lamentation was certainly very appropriate, and in this way Kṛṣṇa tested their sincerity."
