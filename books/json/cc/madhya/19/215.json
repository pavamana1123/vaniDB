	"synonyms": "svarga—the heavenly kingdom; mokṣa—liberation from material bondage; kṛṣṇa-bhakta—a devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa; naraka kari' māne—considers as good as hell; kṛṣṇa-niṣṭhā—being fixed at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa; tṛṣṇa-tyāga—giving up all material desires; śāntera—of one on the neutrality platform; dui guṇe—two transcendental qualities.",
	"translation": "\"When a devotee is situated on the platform of śānta-rasa, he desires neither elevation to the heavenly planets nor liberation. These are the results of karma and jñāna, and the devotee considers them no better than hell. A person situated on the śānta-rasa platform manifests the two transcendental qualities of detachment from all material desire and full attachment to Kṛṣṇa."
