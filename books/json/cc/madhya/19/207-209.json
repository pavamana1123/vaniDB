	"translation": "\" ' \"My dearmost Kṛṣṇa, You are worshiping Me and giving up the company of all the other gopīs who wanted to enjoy themselves with You.\" Thinking like this, Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī considered Herself Kṛṣṇa's most beloved gopī. She had become proud and had left the rāsa-līlā with Kṛṣṇa. In the deep forest She said, \"My dear Kṛṣṇa, I cannot walk any more. You can take Me wherever You like.\" When Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī petitioned Kṛṣṇa in this way, Kṛṣṇa said, \"Just get up upon My shoulders.\" As soon as Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī began to do so, He disappeared. Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī then began to grieve over Her request and Kṛṣṇa's disappearance.'",
