He has His eternal form of bliss and knowledge (sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha). Everything in the Goloka Vṛndāvana planet is a spiritual expansion of sac-cid-ānanda. Everyone there is of the same potency-ānanda-cinmaya-rasa. The relationship between the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His servitor is cinmaya-rasa.

In order to go to the spiritual world after penetrating the cover of the material universe, one must penetrate brahma-loka, the spiritual effulgence. Then one can come to the Goloka Vṛndāvana planet. There are also other planets in the spiritual world called Vaikuṇṭha planets, and on these planets Lord Nārāyaṇa is worshiped with awe and veneration. On these planets the śānta-rasa is prevalent, and some of the devotees are also connected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the dāsya-rasa, the mellow of servitorship. As far as the mellow of fraternity is concerned, the Vaikuṇṭha rasa is represented by gaurava-sakhya, friendship in awe and veneration. The other fraternity rasa is exhibited as viśrambha (friendship in equality), and this is found in the Goloka Vṛndāvana planet. Above that is service to the Lord in vātsalya-rasa (paternal love), and above all is the relationship with the Lord in the mādhurya-rasa (conjugal love). These five rasas are fully exhibited in the spiritual world in one's relationship with the Lord. Therefore in the spiritual world the bhakti-latā creeper finds its resting place at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa."
