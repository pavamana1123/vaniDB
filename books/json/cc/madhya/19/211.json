	"translation": "\"When one is fully attached to Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet, one attains the śamatā stage. The word śamatā is derived from the word śama; therefore śānta-rasa, the position of neutrality, means being fully attached to the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. This is the verdict from the mouth of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. This state is called self-realization.",
