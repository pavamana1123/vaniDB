The young brāhmaṇa said to the Lord, \"You know everything, but if You do not bear witness, You will be involved in sinful activities.\" There is no possibility, however, of the Lord's being involved in sinful activities. A pure devotee, even though he knows everything of the Supreme Lord, can speak with the Lord exactly as if He were a common man. Although the dealings between the Lord and His devotee are always very simple and open, there is formality. All these things happen because of the connection between the Lord and the devotee."
