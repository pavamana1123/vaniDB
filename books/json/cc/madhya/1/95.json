He therefore called for His mother and the devotees from Māyāpura, and by the arrangement of Śrī Advaita Ācārya, He met them for the last time after His acceptance of sannyāsa. His mother was overwhelmed with grief when she saw that He was clean-shaven. There was no longer any beautiful hair on His head. Mother Śacī was pacified by all the devotees, and Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu asked her to cook for Him because He was very hungry, not having taken anything for three days. His mother immediately agreed, and forgetting everything else, she cooked for Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu during all the days she was at the house of Śrī Advaita Prabhu. Then, after a few days, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu requested His mother's permission to go to Jagannātha Purī. At His mother's request, He made Jagannātha Purī His headquarters after His acceptance of sannyāsa. Thus everything was adjusted, and with His mother's permission Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu proceeded toward Jagannātha Purī."
