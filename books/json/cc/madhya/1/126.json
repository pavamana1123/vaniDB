			"type": "normal",
			"content": "Being absolute, Lord Jagannātha is identical in person, form, picture, kīrtana and all other circumstances. Therefore when Caitanya Mahāprabhu heard the chanting of the holy name of the Lord, He was pacified. Previously, He had been feeling very morose due to separation from Jagannātha. The conclusion is that whenever a kīrtana of pure devotees takes place, the Lord is immediately present. By chanting the holy names of the Lord, we associate with the Lord personally."
