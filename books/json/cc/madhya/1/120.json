Caitanya Mahāprabhu found Brahma-saṁhitā and Kṛṣṇa-karṇāmṛta in handwritten texts, and knowing them to be very authoritative, He took them with Him to present to His devotees. Of course, He obtained the permission of the temple commander. Now both Brahma-saṁhitā and Kṛṣṇa-karṇāmṛta are available in print with commentaries by Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura."
