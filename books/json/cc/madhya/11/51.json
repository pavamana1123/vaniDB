As confirmed elsewhere in Caitanya-caritāmṛta (Madhya 19.151), guru-kṛṣṇa-prasāde pāya bhakti-latā-bīja: \"By the mercy of the spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa, one gets the seed of devotional service.\" The Bhaṭṭācārya was the spiritual master of King Pratāparudra, and he gave his blessings to the effect that the Lord would be merciful upon the King. The mercy of the spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa combine to grant success to a devotee engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This is confirmed by the Vedas:"
