	"translation": "Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then recited the following verse: \" 'My dear Lord, one who always keeps Your holy name on his tongue becomes greater than an initiated brāhmaṇa. Although he may be born in a family of dog-eaters and therefore by material calculation may be the lowest among men, he is still glorious. This is the wonderful effect of chanting the holy name of the Lord. It is therefore concluded that one who chants the holy name of the Lord should be understood to have performed all kinds of austerities and great sacrifices mentioned in the Vedas. He has already taken his bath in all the holy places of pilgrimage. He has studied all the Vedas, and he is actually an Āryan.' \"",

			"content": "The word Āryan means advanced. Unless one is spiritually advanced, he cannot be called an Āryan, and this is the difference between Āryan and non-Āryan. Non-Āryans are those who are not spiritually advanced. By following the Vedic culture, by performing great sacrifices and by becoming a strict follower of the Vedic instructions, one may become a brāhmaṇa, a sannyāsī or an Āryan. It is not possible to become a brāhmaṇa, sannyāsī or Āryan without being properly qualified. Bhāgavata-dharma never allows one to become a cheap brāhmaṇa, sannyāsī or Āryan. The qualities or qualifications described herein are quoted from Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (3.33.7) and were spoken by Devahūti, the mother of Kapiladeva, when she understood the influence of devotional service (bhakti-yoga). In this way Devahūti praised the devotee, pointing out his greatness in all respects."
