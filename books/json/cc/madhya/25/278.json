	"synonyms": "ye—he who; līlā—of the pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa and Caitanya Mahāprabhu; amṛta vine—without nectar; khāya yadi anna-pāne—if one eats only ordinary food grains; tabe—then; bhaktera—of the devotees; durbala jīvana—life becomes weakened; yāra—of which; eka-bindu-pāne—if one drinks one drop; utphullita tanu-mane—the body and mind become jubilant; hāse—laughs; gāya—chants; karaye nartana—dances.",
	"translation": "Men become strong and stout by eating sufficient grains, but the devotee who simply eats ordinary grains but does not taste the transcendental pastimes of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Kṛṣṇa gradually becomes weak and falls down from the transcendental position. However, if one drinks but a drop of the nectar of Kṛṣṇa's pastimes, his body and mind begin to bloom, and he begins to laugh, sing and dance.",

Thus they will miss the opportunity to attain an eternal, blissful life of transcendental pleasure."
