If we simply take one side of the Supreme Personality of Godhead-His impersonal effulgence-that one side does not fully explain the Absolute Truth. Impersonal appreciation of the Absolute Truth is one-sided and incomplete. One should also accept the other side, the personal side-Bhagavān. Brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate. One should not be satisfied simply by understanding the Brahman feature of the Personality of Godhead. One must also know the Lord's personal feature. That is complete understanding of the Absolute Truth."
