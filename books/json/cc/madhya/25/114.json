	"translation": "\" 'In the verse beginning \"aham eva,\" the word \"aham\" is expressed three times. In the beginning there are the words \"aham eva.\" In the second line there are the words \"paścād aham.\" At the end are the words \"so' smy aham.\" This \"aham\" indicates the Supreme Person. By the repetition of \"aham,\" the transcendental personality who is complete with six opulences is confirmed."
