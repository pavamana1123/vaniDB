	"synonyms": "ei amṛta—this nectar; anukṣaṇa—continuously; sādhu mahānta-megha-gaṇa—pure devotees and saintly persons, who are compared to clouds; viśva-udyāne—in the garden of the universe; kare variṣaṇa—rain down these nectarean pastimes of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa; tāte—because of that; phale—grows; amṛta-phala—the fruit of nectar; bhakta khāya nirantara—and the devotees eat such fruit continuously; tāra śeṣe—after their eating; jīye jaga-jana—the living entities all over the world live peacefully.",
	"translation": "The devotees who have taken shelter of the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu take the responsibility for distributing nectarean devotional service all over the world. They are like clouds pouring water on the ground that nourishes the fruit of love of Godhead in this world. The devotees eat that fruit to their hearts' content, and whatever remnants they leave are eaten by the general populace. Thus they live happily."
