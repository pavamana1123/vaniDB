	"translation": "\"The transcendental mellows generated from the dealings between the gopīs and Kṛṣṇa cannot be tasted by fruitive activity, yogic austerities, speculative knowledge, regulative devotional service, mantra-yoga or meditation. This sweetness can be tasted only through the spontaneous love of liberated persons who chant the holy names with great ecstatic love."
