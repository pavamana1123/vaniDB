	"synonyms": "se dhvani—that vibration; cau-dike—in the four directions; dhāya—runs; aṇḍa bhedi'-piercing the coverings of the universe; vaikuṇṭhe yāya—goes to the spiritual sky; bale—by force; paiśe—enters; jagatera—of the three worlds; kāṇe—in the ears; sabā—everyone; mātoyāla kari'-making drunk; balātkāre—by force; āne—brings; dhari'-catching; viśeṣataḥ—specifically; yuvatīra gaṇe—all the young damsels of Vrajabhūmi.",
	"translation": "\"The sound of Kṛṣṇa's flute spreads in four directions. Even though Kṛṣṇa vibrates His flute within this universe, its sound pierces the universal covering and goes to the spiritual sky. Thus the vibration enters the ears of all inhabitants. It especially enters Goloka Vṛndāvana-dhāma and attracts the minds of the young damsels of Vrajabhūmi, bringing them forcibly to where Kṛṣṇa is present."
