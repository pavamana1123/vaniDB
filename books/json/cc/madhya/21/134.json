	"translation": "\" 'The creator says, \"Let those who will see Kṛṣṇa's beautiful face have two eyes.\" Just see the lack of consideration exhibited by this person posing as a creator. If the creator took my advice, he would give millions of eyes to the person who intends to see Śrī Kṛṣṇa's face. If the creator will accept this advice, then I would say that he is competent in his work.'"
