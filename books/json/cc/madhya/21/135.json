A particularly extraordinary vision is the moon above that ocean, and another vision is His smile, which is sweeter than sweet and is like shining beams of moonlight.\" While speaking of these things with Sanātana Gosvāmī, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu began to remember one thing after another. Moving His hands in ecstasy, He recited a verse."
