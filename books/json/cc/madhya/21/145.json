	"translation": "Resuming His external consciousness, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu told Sanātana Gosvāmī, \"I have not spoken of what I intended. Lord Kṛṣṇa is very merciful to you because by bewildering My mind, He has exposed His personal opulence and sweetness. He has caused you to hear all these things from Me for your understanding.",

Statements about Kṛṣṇa's body, His characteristics and His flute would appear like a madman's statements to a mundane person. It was actually a fact that Kṛṣṇa wanted to expose Himself to Sanātana Gosvāmī due to His specific mercy upon him. Somehow or other, Kṛṣṇa explained Himself and His flute to Sanātana Gosvāmī through the mouth of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who appeared as though mad. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu admitted that He wanted to tell Sanātana Gosvāmī something else, but somehow or other, in a transcendental ecstasy, He spoke of a different subject matter."
