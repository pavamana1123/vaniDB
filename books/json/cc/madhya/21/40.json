	"synonyms": "ei tina—these three; sarva-āśraya—the shelter of the whole material creation; jagat-īśvara—supreme controllers of the universe; eho saba—all of Them; kalā-aṁśa—plenary portions, or portions of the plenary portions; kṛṣṇa—Lord Kṛṣṇa; adhīśvara—the Supreme Personality of Godhead.",
	"translation": "\"Although Mahā-Viṣṇu, Padmanābha and Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu are all shelters and controllers of the entire universe, They are nonetheless but plenary portions or portions of the plenary portions of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore He is the original Personality of Godhead."
