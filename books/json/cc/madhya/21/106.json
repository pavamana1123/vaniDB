	"translation": "\"The beauty of Kṛṣṇa's body is so attractive that it attracts not only the demigods and other living entities within this material world but the personalities of the spiritual sky as well, including the Nārāyaṇas, who are expansions of Kṛṣṇa's personality. The minds of the Nārāyaṇas are thus attracted by the beauty of Kṛṣṇa's body. In addition, the goddesses of fortune [Lakṣmīs]-who are wives of the Nārāyaṇas and are the women described in the Vedas as most chaste-are also attracted by the wonderful beauty of Kṛṣṇa."
