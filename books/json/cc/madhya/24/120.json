	"translation": "\" 'The nine Yogendras entered Lord Brahmā's association and heard from him the real meaning of the topmost Vedic literatures-the Upaniṣads. Although they were already conversant in Vedic knowledge, they became very jubilant in Kṛṣṇa consciousness just by listening to Brahmā. Thus they wanted to enter Dvārakā, the abode of Lord Kṛṣṇa. In this way they finally achieved the place known as Raṅga-kṣetra.'",
