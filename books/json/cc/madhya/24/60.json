			"content": "The four miserable conditions are due to the four kinds of sinful activities, known as (1) pātaka, (2) urupātaka, (3) mahā-pātaka and (4) atipātaka-preliminary sin, very great sin, greater sin and topmost sin. However, Kṛṣṇa assures the devotee, ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ: \"I will protect you from all sinful reactions. Do not fear.\" The word sarva-pāpebhyaḥ indicates four kinds of sinful activity. As soon as the devotee surrenders unto Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet, he is certainly relieved from all sinful activities and their results. The four basic sinful activities are summarized as illicit sex, intoxication, gambling and meat-eating."
