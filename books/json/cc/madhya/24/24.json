Not only does He carry the three worlds by His inconceivable energy, but He maintains them also. He is also maintaining His spiritual planet, Goloka Vṛndāvana, by His conjugal love, and He is maintaining the Vaikuṇṭhalokas by His opulences. He maintains these material universes through the external energy. Material universes are perfectly situated because they are created by the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
