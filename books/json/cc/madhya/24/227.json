	"synonyms": "nirgrantha-śabde—by the word nirgrantha; kahe—is said; tabe—therefore; vyādha—a hunter; nirdhana—without any riches; sādhu-saṅge—by the association of a saintly person; seha—he also; kare—engages himself; śrī-kṛṣṇa-bhajana—in the devotional service of Lord Kṛṣṇa.",
	"translation": "\"The word nirgrantha-when combined with api, used in the sense of certainty-indicates a person who is a hunter by profession or who is very poor. Nonetheless, when such a person associates with a great saint like Nārada, he engages in Lord Kṛṣṇa's devotional service."
