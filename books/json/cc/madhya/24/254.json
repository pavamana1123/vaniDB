			"content": "By the grace of Nārada Muni, the hunter came to his good senses and immediately surrendered unto the saint's lotus feet. This is the process. By associating with a saintly person, one is able to understand the reactions of his sinful life. When one voluntarily surrenders to a saintly person who is a representative of Kṛṣṇa and follows his instructions, one can become freed from sinful reaction. Kṛṣṇa demands the surrender of a sinful man, and Kṛṣṇa's representative gives the same instructions. The representative of Kṛṣṇa never tells his disciple, \"Surrender unto me.\" Rather he says, \"Surrender unto Kṛṣṇa.\" If the disciple accepts this principle and surrenders himself through the representative of Kṛṣṇa, his life is saved."
