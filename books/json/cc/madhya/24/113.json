	"synonyms": "janma haite—from birth; śuka—Śukadeva Gosvāmī; sanaka-ādi—the four Kumāras; brahma-maya—absorbed in the thought of impersonal Brahman; kṛṣṇa-guṇa-ākṛṣṭa—attracted by the transcendental pastimes of the Lord; hañā—becoming; kṛṣṇere bhajaya—worshiped Lord Kṛṣṇa.",
	"translation": "\"Although Śukadeva Gosvāmī and the four Kumāras were always absorbed in the thought of impersonal Brahman and were thus Brahmavādīs, they were nonetheless attracted by the transcendental pastimes and qualities of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore they later became devotees of Kṛṣṇa."
