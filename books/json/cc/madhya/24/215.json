The great sages were headed by Śaunaka, and Sūta Gosvāmī spoke of the glorious activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead at that meeting. At that time, all the ṛṣis assembled there neglected to complete the ritualistic ceremonies because there was no positive assurance of the results. All the performers were coated with black ash due to the large amount of smoke coming from the fire."
