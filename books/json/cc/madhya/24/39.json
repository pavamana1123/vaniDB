	"synonyms": "bhukti—material happiness; mukti—liberation from material suffering; siddhi—the perfection of mystic yoga; sukha—the happiness derived from these things; chāḍaya—one gives up; yāra—of which; gandhe—simply by the slight fragrance; alaukika—uncommon, transcendental; śakti-guṇe—by the power and quality; kṛṣṇa-kṛpāya—by the mercy of Lord Kṛṣṇa; bāndhe—one becomes bound.",
	"translation": "\"Pure devotional service is so sublime that one can very easily forget the happiness derived from material happiness, material liberation and mystic or yogic perfection. Thus the devotee is bound by Kṛṣṇa's mercy and His uncommon power and qualifications."
