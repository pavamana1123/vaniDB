	"synonyms": "ca-śabde—by the word ca; anvācaye—in presenting an action of secondary importance; artha—meaning; kahe—says; āra—another; baṭo—O brahmacārī: bhikṣām aṭa—just bring some alms; gām ca ānaya—also, at the same time, bring the cows; yaiche prakāra—in this way.",
	"translation": "\"The word ca also means anvācaye, which means to present a secondary thing to be done at the same time. This is the way of understanding the word anvācaye. An example is: 'O brahmacārī, go out to collect alms and at the same time bring in the cows.'"
