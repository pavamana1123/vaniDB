Those who are attracted to the materialistic way of life and who are always agitated and full of anxiety worship demigods who appear fierce, demigods like goddess Kālī and Kāla-bhairava (Rudra). The devotees of Kṛṣṇa, however, do not envy the demigods or their worshipers but peacefully render devotional service to the incarnations of Nārāyaṇa instead."
