In other words, one has to become a madman like Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Apart from being the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is an ācārya who exhibited love of God like a madman. According to His own written verse: yugāyitaṁ nimeṣeṇa. He says that for Him, \"a moment seems to last twelve years.\" Cakṣuṣā prāvṛṣāyitam: \"My tears are flowing like torrents of rain.\" Śūnyāyitaṁ jagat sarvam: \"I feel as if the entire universe were vacant.\" Why? Govinda-viraheṇa me: \"Due to My being separated from Govinda, Kṛṣṇa.\""

			"content": "One can understand Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam only by following in the footsteps of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who was mad for Kṛṣṇa. We cannot, of course, imitate Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. It is not possible. However, unless one is very serious about understanding Kṛṣṇa, he cannot understand Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam gives the full narration of Kṛṣṇa's transcendental activities. The first nine cantos explain who Kṛṣṇa is, and the Lord's birth and activities are narrated in the Tenth Canto. In Bhagavad-gītā it is stated: janma karma ca me divyam. Kṛṣṇa's appearance and disappearance are transcendental, not mundane. A person is eligible to return home, back to Godhead, if he perfectly understands Kṛṣṇa and His appearance and disappearance. This is verified by Bhagavad-gītā: tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti so 'rjuna."
