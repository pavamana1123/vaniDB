	"synonyms": "dehārāmī—those in the bodily concept of life; karma-niṣṭha—attracted to fruitive activities; yājñika-ādi jana—persons who perform ritualistic ceremonies for a better standard of life; sat-saṅge—in contact with devotees; karma tyaji'-giving up such fruitive activities; karaya bhajana—engages in the devotional service of the Lord.",
	"translation": "\"Those who are in the bodily conception mainly engage in fruitive activity. Those who perform yajñas and ritualistic ceremonies are also considered in the same category. However, when they are all in contact with the pure devotee, they give up their fruitive activity and fully engage in the service of the Lord."
