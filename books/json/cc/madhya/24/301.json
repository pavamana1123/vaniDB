	"synonyms": "ātmārāmāḥ ca—similarly the word ātmārāmāḥ with the word ca added; samuccaye—in aggregation; kahiye—means; ca-kāra—the word ca; munayaḥ ca—the word munayaḥ with the word ca added; bhakti kare—all of them engage in devotional service; ei artha tāra—this is the perfect meaning of the verse.",
	"translation": "\"After fifty-eight times uttering the word ātmārāmāḥ and taking ca in a sense of aggregation, one may add the word munayaḥ. That will mean that they also render devotional service to Lord Kṛṣṇa. In this way there are fifty-nine meanings."
