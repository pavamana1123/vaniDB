	"synonyms": "sei sabera—of all those worshipers of different demigods; sādhu-saṅge—the contact of real devotees; guṇa sphurāya—awakens the appreciation of transcendental qualities; kṛṣṇa-bhajana karāya—engages in the devotional service of Lord Kṛṣṇa; mumukṣā chāḍāya—and causes to give up the desire to be liberated or merge into the impersonal feature of the Lord.",
	"translation": "\"If those who are attached to demigod worship fortunately associate with the devotees, their dormant devotional service and appreciation of the Lord's qualities gradually awaken. In this way they also engage in Kṛṣṇa's devotional service and give up the desire for liberation and the desire to merge into the existence of impersonal Brahman.",

There are three kinds of impersonalists-the mumukṣu (those desiring liberation), the jīvan-muktas (those liberated in this life) and the prāpta-svarūpas (those merged in Brahman realization). All three types of jñānīs are called mokṣākāṅkṣīs, those desiring liberation. By associating with devotees, such people give up the mumukṣu principle and render devotional service. The real cause for this change is the association of devotees. This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is meant to attract all types of men, even those who desire things other than the Lord's devotional service. Through the association of devotees, they gradually begin to render devotional service."
