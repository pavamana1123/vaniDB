	"synonyms": "tapasvī—persons who undergo severe penances; prabhṛti—and so on; yata—all; dehārāmī haya—are within the category of the bodily concept of life; sādhu-saṅge—in the association of devotees; tapa chāḍi'-giving up all such processes of penance and austerity; śrī-kṛṣṇa bhajaya—engage themselves in the service of Lord Kṛṣṇa.",
	"translation": "\"The tapasvīs, those who undergo severe austerities and penances to elevate themselves to the higher planetary systems, are also in the same category. When such persons come in contact with a devotee, they give up all those practices and engage in Lord Kṛṣṇa's service."
