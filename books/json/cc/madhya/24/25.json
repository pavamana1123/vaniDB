			"content": "In Sanskrit the verb \"to do\" has two forms, technically called parasmaipada and ātmanepada. When things are done for one's personal satisfaction, the form is called ātmanepada. In that case, the word \"do\" in English is kurvante in Sanskrit. When things are done for others, the verb form changes to kurvanti. Thus Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu informed Sanātana Gosvāmī that in the ātmārāma verse the verb kurvanti means that things should be done only for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa. This is supported by the grammarian Pāṇini. The verb is formed as ātmanepada when the work is to be done for one's own benefit, and when it is done for others, it is called parasmaipada. Thus the verb is formed according to whether something is done for one's self-satisfaction or for another's satisfaction."
