	"synonyms": "ca-śabde—by the word ca; eva—the word eva; api-śabda—the word api; samuccaye—in the sense of aggregation; ātmārāmāḥ eva—all the ātmārāmas (all kinds of living entities); hañā—being; śrī-kṛṣṇa bhajaye—become engaged in the service of Lord Kṛṣṇa.",
	"translation": "\"In that case, by the word ca, the word eva is meant. The word api can be taken in the sense of aggregation. Thus the verse would read ātmārāmā eva; that is, 'even all kinds of living beings worship Kṛṣṇa.'",

			"content": "It is here mentioned that every living entity is ātmārāma. Temporarily covered by the influence of māyā, the living entity serves his senses, which are represented as kāma-krodha-lobha-moha-mada-mātsarya. In the material condition, all living entities are engaged in sense gratification, but when they associate with devotees who follow the regulative principles, they become purified and awakened to their original consciousness. They then attempt to satisfy the senses of Lord Kṛṣṇa and engage in His devotional service."
