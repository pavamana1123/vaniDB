When the sages, headed by Śaunaka, inquired about Kapiladeva, the incarnation of Godhead, Suta Gosvāmī, who was the topmost devotee of the Lord, quoted talks about self-realization between Maitreya, a friend of Vyāsadeva, and Vidura. It was then that the topic of Lord Kapila came up and His discussions with His mother, wherein He stated that attachment to material things is the cause of conditional life. When a person becomes attached to transcendental things, he is on the path of liberation."
