	"translation": "\" 'When an advanced realized devotee hears about the affairs of the devotees of Vṛndāvana-in the mellows of śānta, dāsya, sakhya, vātsalya and mādhurya-he becomes inclined in that way, and his intelligence becomes attracted. Indeed, he begins to covet that particular type of devotion. When such covetousness is awakened, one's intelligence no longer depends on the instruction of śāstra, revealed scripture, logic or argument.'",
