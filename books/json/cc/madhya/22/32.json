	"translation": "\" 'The external illusory energy of Kṛṣṇa, known as māyā, is always ashamed to stand in front of Kṛṣṇa, just as darkness is ashamed to remain before the sunshine. However, that māyā bewilders unfortunate people who have no intelligence. Thus they simply boast that this material world is theirs and that they are its enjoyers.'",

This is the basic principle behind nationalism, socialism and communism. Such thinking, which simply bewilders the living being, is nothing but rascalism. It is due to the darkness of māyā, but as soon as one becomes Kṛṣṇa conscious, he is immediately relieved from such misconceptions. This verse is quoted from Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (2.5.13). There is also another appropriate verse in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (2.7.47):"

Nārada was surprised to see the creator of the universe meditating, for he was doubting whether there was someone greater than Lord Brahmā. While answering the great sage Nārada, Lord Brahmā described the position of māyā and the bewildered living entities. This verse was spoken in that connection."
