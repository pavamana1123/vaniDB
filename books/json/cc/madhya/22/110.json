If one has heard properly about the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his duty is to glorify the Lord and preach His glories. This is called kīrtitavyaḥ. When one hears about the Lord and glorifies Him, it is natural to think of Him. This is called smartavyaḥ. All this must be carried out if one actually wants to be immune from fear."
