Lusty desires and greed are associated with rajas and tamas, darkness and passion. When one becomes Kṛṣṇa conscious, the modes of darkness and passion immediately vanish, and the remaining mode, sattva-guṇa (goodness), remains. When one is situated in the mode of goodness, he can make spiritual advancement and understand things clearly. This position is not possible for everyone. When a person is Kṛṣṇa conscious, he continuously hears about Kṛṣṇa, thinks about Him, worships Him and serves Him as a devotee. If he remains in Kṛṣṇa consciousness in this way, the darkness of māyā certainly will not be able to touch him."
