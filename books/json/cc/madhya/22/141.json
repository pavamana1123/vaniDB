			"content": "\"By performing oblations with ghee, the demigods are satisfied. By studying the Vedas, brahma-yajña is performed, and by this the great sages are satisfied. Offering libations of water before one's forefathers is called pitṛ-yajña. By offering tribute, bhūta-yajña is performed. By properly receiving guests, nṛ-yajña is performed.\" There are five yajñas and five kinds of indebtedness-indebtedness to the demigods, great sages, forefathers, living entities and common men. Therefore one has to perform five kinds of yajñas, but when one takes to saṅkīrtana-yajña (the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra) one doesn't have to perform any other yajña. In Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Nārada Muni made a statement about the systematic performance of bhāgavata-dharma in connection with statements previously made by the nine Yogendras before Mahārāja Nimi. The sage Karabhājana Ṛṣi explained the four incarnations of the four yugas, and at the end, in this verse (text 141), he explained the position of Kṛṣṇa's pure devotee and how he is absolved of all debts."
