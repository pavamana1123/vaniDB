	"synonyms": "śaraṇāgatera—of a person who has fully taken shelter of Kṛṣṇa; akiñcanera—of a person who is free of all material desires; eka-i lakṣaṇa—the symptoms are one and the same; tāra madhye—of them all; praveśaye—enters; ātma-samarpaṇa—full surrender.",
	"translation": "\"There are two kinds of devotees-those who are fully satiated and free from all material desires and those who are fully surrendered to the lotus feet of the Lord. Their qualities are one and the same, but those who are fully surrendered to Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet are qualified with another transcendental quality-ātma-samarpaṇa, full surrender without reservation."
