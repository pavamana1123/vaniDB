			"content": "Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura explains this point. Is this bhāgya (fortune) the result of an accident or something else? In the scriptures, devotional service and pious activity are considered fortunate. Pious activities can be divided into three categories-pious activities that awaken one's dormant Kṛṣṇa consciousness are called bhakty-unmukhī sukṛti. Pious activities that bestow material opulence are called bhogonmukhī, and pious activities that enable the living entity to merge into the existence of the Supreme are called mokṣonmukhī. These last two awards of pious activity are not actually fortunate. Pious activities are fortunate when they help one become Kṛṣṇa conscious. The good fortune of bhakty-unmukhī is attainable only when one comes in contact with a devotee. By associating with a devotee willingly or unwillingly, one advances in devotional service, and thus one's dormant Kṛṣṇa consciousness is awakened."
