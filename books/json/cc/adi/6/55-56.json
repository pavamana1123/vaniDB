	"synonyms": "anyera—of others; kā—what; kathā—to speak; vraje—in Vṛndāvana; nanda mahāśaya—Nanda Mahārāja; tāra sama—like him; guru—a superior; kṛṣṇera—of Lord Kṛṣṇa; āra—another; keha—anyone; naya—not; śuddha-vātsalye—in transcendental paternal love; īśvara-jñāna—conception of the Supreme Lord; nāhi—not; tāra—his; tāhākei—unto him; preme—ecstatic love; karāya—makes; dāsya-anukāra—the conception of being a servant.",
	"translation": "Although no one is a more respected elder for Kṛṣṇa than Nanda Mahārāja in Vraja, who in transcendental paternal love has no knowledge that his son is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, still ecstatic love makes him, what to speak of others, feel himself to be a servant of Lord Kṛṣṇa."
