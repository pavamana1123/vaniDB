The devotees of Kṛṣṇa, however, in their loving relationships with Kṛṣṇa, sometimes forget their own identities; sometimes they think themselves one with Kṛṣṇa and yet relish still greater transcendental mellow in that way. People in general, because of their foolishness only, try to become masters of everything, forgetting the transcendental mellow of servitorship to the Lord. When a person is actually advanced in spiritual understanding, however, he can accept the transcendental servitorship of the Lord without hesitation."
