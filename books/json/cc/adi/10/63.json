The Lord could understand the feelings of the boys, and He asked His personal assistant Govinda to supply them prasāda until the party of Śivānanda arrived. During the Ratha-yātrā saṅkīrtana festival these two brothers were members of the party led by Mukunda. In the Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā, verse 174, it is said that the gopī whose name was Kātyāyanī appeared as Śrīkānta Sena."
