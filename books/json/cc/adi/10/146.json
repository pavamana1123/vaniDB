Generally a sannyāsī takes prasāda at the house of a gṛhastha, and a brahmacārī helps in this connection. A sannyāsī is supposed to be a spiritual master and a brahmacārī his disciple. Balabhadra Bhaṭṭācārya acted as a brahmacārī for Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu when the Lord toured Mathurā and Vṛndāvana."
