In the Malabar state, members of the Bhaṭṭathāri cult tried to captivate Kṛṣṇadāsa by supplying a woman to seduce him, but although Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu saved him from being harmed, when they returned to Jagannātha Purī He asked Kṛṣṇadāsa to remain there, for the Lord was never favorably disposed toward an associate who was attracted by a woman. Thus Kṛṣṇadāsa lost the personal association of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu."
