Similarly, Lakṣmīnātha Paṇḍita is mentioned as Rasonmādā, and Baṅgavāṭī Caitanya dāsa is mentioned as Kālī. The Śākhā-nirṇaya states that Baṅgavāṭī Caitanya dāsa was always seen with eyes full of tears. He also had a branch of descendants. Their names were Mathurāprasāda, Rukmiṇīkānta, Jīvanakṛṣṇa, Yugalakiśora, Ratanakṛṣṇa, Rādhāmādhava, Ūṣāmaṇi, Vaikuṇṭhanātha and Lālamohana, or Lālamohana Śāhā Śāṅkhānidhi. Lālamohana was a great merchant in the city of Dacca. The Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā, verses 194 and 200, mentions that Raghunātha was formerly Varāṅgadā."
