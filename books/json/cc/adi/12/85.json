Sādipuriyā Gopāla is celebrated as a preacher of the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement in Vikramapura, in East Bengal. Kṛṣṇadāsa Brahmacārī was formerly among the group of sakhīs known as the aṣṭa-sakhīs. His name was Indulekhā. Kṛṣṇadāsa Brahmacārī lived in Vṛndāvana. There is a tomb in the Rādhā-Dāmodara temple known as Kṛṣṇadāsa's tomb. Some say that this is the tomb of Kṛṣṇadāsa Brahmacārī and others Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī. In either case we offer our respects because both of them were expert in distributing love of Godhead to the fallen souls of this age. The Śākhā-nirṇaya mentions that Puṣpagopāla was formerly known as Svarṇagrāmaka."
