Similarly, verse 35 mentions Uddhava dāsa as being greatly qualified in distributing love of Godhead to everyone. The Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā, verse 202, mentions Jitāmitra as the gopī named Śyāma-mañjarī. Jitāmitra wrote a book entitled Kṛṣṇa-māyurya. Jagannātha dāsa was a resident of Vikramapura, near Dacca. His birthplace was the village known as Kāṣṭhakāṭā or Kāṭhādiyā. His descendants now reside in villages known as Āḍiyala, Kāmārapāḍā and Pāikapāḍā. He established a temple of Yaśomādhava. The worshipers in this temple are the Gosvāmīs of Āḍiyala. As one of the sixty-four sakhīs, he was formerly an assistant of Citrādevī-gopī named Tilakinī. The following is a list of his descendants: Rāmanṛsiṁha, Rāmagopāla, Rāmacandra, Sanātana, Muktārāma, Gopīnātha, Goloka, Harimohana Śiromaṇi, Rākhālarāja, Mādhava and Lakṣmīkānta. The Śākhā-nirṇaya mentions that Jagannātha dāsa preached the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement in the district or state of Tripura."
