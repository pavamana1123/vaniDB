As we have discussed hereinbefore, the representatives of Advaita Ācārya later divided into two groups-the bona fide branches of the ācārya's disciplic succession and the pretentious branches of Advaita Ācārya. Those who followed the principles of Caitanya Mahāprabhu flourished, whereas the others, who are mentioned below in the sixty-seventh verse, dried up."
