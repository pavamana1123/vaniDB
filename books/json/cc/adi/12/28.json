Kamalākānta, a very confidential servant of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu born in a brāhmaṇa family, engaged in the service of Śrī Advaita Ācārya as His secretary. When Paramānanda Purī went from Navadvīpa to Jagannātha Purī, he took Kamalākānta Viśvāsa with him, and they both went to see Lord Caitanya at Jagannātha Purī. It is mentioned in the Madhya-līlā (10.94) that one of the devotees of Lord Caitanya, the brāhmaṇa Kamalākānta, went with Paramānanda Purī to Jagannātha Purī."
