The Lord ordered Govinda, His personal assistant, not to allow Kamalākānta Viśvāsa to come in His presence because he had become a bāuliyā. Thus although the bāula-sampradāya, āula-sampradāya and sahajiyā-sampradāya, as well as the smārtas, jāta-gosāñis, atibāḍis, cūḍādhārīs and gaurāṅga-nāgarīs, claim to belong to the disciplic succession of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the Lord actually rejected them."
