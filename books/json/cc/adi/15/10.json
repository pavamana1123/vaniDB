It appears that before the request of Lord Caitanya Śacīmātā was not observing Ekādaśī because of her being sa-dhava, which means that her husband was living. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, however, introduced the system that a woman, even if not a widow, must observe the Ekādaśī day and must not touch any kind of grains, even those offered to the Deity of Viṣṇu."
