As stated in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (11.2.42), bhaktir pareśānubhavo viraktir anyatra ca: in bhakti, a devotee's only attachment is Kṛṣṇa; he no longer wants to maintain his attachments to many other things. Although Māyāvādī philosophers are supposed to be very advanced on the path of liberation, we see that after some time they descend to politics and philanthropic activities. Many big sannyāsīs who were supposedly liberated and very advanced have come down again to materialistic activities, although they left this world as mithyā (false). When a devotee develops in devotional service, however, he no longer has attachments to such philanthropic activities. He is simply inspired to serve the Lord, and he engages his entire life in such service. This is the difference between Vaiṣṇava and Māyāvādī philosophers. Devotional service, therefore, is practical, whereas Māyāvāda philosophy is merely mental speculation."
