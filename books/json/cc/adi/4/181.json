The gopīs dressed themselves as beautifully as possible, just to make Kṛṣṇa happy by seeing them. They had no ulterior desires. They dedicated their bodies, and everything they possessed, to the service of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, taking for granted that their bodies were meant for His enjoyment. They dressed themselves on the understanding that Kṛṣṇa would be happy by seeing and touching them."
