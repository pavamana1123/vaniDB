Everyone follows the path that leads toward Him, but there are different degrees of progress on that path, and the Lord is realized in proportion to one's advancement. The path is one, but the progress in approaching the ultimate goal is different, and therefore the proportion of realization of this goal-namely the absolute Personality of Godhead-is also different. The gopīs attained the highest goal, and Lord Caitanya affirmed that there is no higher method of worshiping God than that followed by the gopīs."
