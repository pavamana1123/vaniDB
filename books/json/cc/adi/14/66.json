			"content": "\"Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction. Do not fear.\" (Bg. 18.66) People do not understand this. They are accustomed to flatter or worship many demigods, human beings, or even cats and dogs, but when requested to worship the Supreme Lord, they refuse. This is called illusion. Factually, if one worships the Supreme Lord there is no need to worship anyone else. For example, in a village of a limited area one may use different wells for different purposes, but when one goes to a river where there is water constantly flowing in waves, that water can serve all his purposes. When there is a river, one can take drinking water, wash his clothes, bathe and so on, for that water will serve all purposes. Similarly, if one worships the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, all his goals will be achieved. Kāmais tais tair hṛta-jñānāḥ prapadyante 'nya-devatāḥ: only men who have lost their intelligence worship the various demigods to fulfill their desires (Bg. 7.20)."
