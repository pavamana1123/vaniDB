	"synonyms": "yasya—one who; asti—has; bhaktiḥ—devotional service; bhagavati—unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead; akiñcanā—without motive; sarvaiḥ—all; guṇaiḥ—qualities; tatra—there; samāsate—become manifested; surāḥ—with all the demigods; harau—unto the Supreme Personality; abhaktasya—one who is not a devotee; kutaḥ—where; mahat-guṇāḥ—high qualities; manaḥ-rathena—concoction; asati—the material existence; dhāvataḥ—run on; bahiḥ—externally.",
	"translation": "\"In one who has unflinching devotional faith in Kṛṣṇa, all the good qualities of Kṛṣṇa and the demigods are consistently manifested. However, one who has no devotion to the Supreme Personality of Godhead has no good qualifications because he is engaged by mental concoction in material existence, which is the external feature of the Lord.\""
