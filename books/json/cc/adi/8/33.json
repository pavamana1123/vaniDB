			"content": "Śrī Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura's Caitanya-bhāgavata was originally entitled Caitanya-maṅgala, but when Śrīla Locana dāsa Ṭhākura later wrote another book named Caitanya-maṅgala, Śrīla Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura changed the name of his own book, which is now therefore known as Caitanya-bhāgavata. The life of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is very elaborately described in the Caitanya-bhāgavata, and Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī has already informed us that in his Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta he has described whatever Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura has not mentioned. This acceptance of Śrī Caitanya-bhāgavata by Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī indicates his acceptance of the disciplic succession. A writer of transcendental literature never tries to surpass the previous ācāryas."
