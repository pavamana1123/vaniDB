			"content": "According to the system of Vedic society, whenever an unknown sannyāsī comes to a village or town, someone must invite him to take prasāda in his home. Sannyāsīs generally take prasāda in the house of a brāhmaṇa because the brāhmaṇa worships the Lord Nārāyaṇa śilā, or śālagrāma-śilā, and therefore there is prasāda that the sannyāsī may take. Keśava Bhāratī accepted the invitation of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Thus the Lord had a good opportunity to explain His desire to take sannyāsa from him."
