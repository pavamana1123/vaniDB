In this connection the sahajiyās cite a malicious story that after eating the remnants of Lord Caitanya's food Nārāyaṇī became pregnant and gave birth to Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura. The rascal sahajiyās may manufacture such false statements, but no one should believe them because they are motivated by enmity against the Vaiṣṇavas."
