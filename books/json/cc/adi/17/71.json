When Viśvarūpa took sannyāsa, Śacīmātā thought that Advaita Ācārya had persuaded Him to do so. Therefore she accused Him of this, which was an offense at Advaita Ācārya's lotus feet. Later Lord Caitanya induced His mother to take the dust of Advaita Ācārya's lotus feet, and thus her vaiṣṇava-aparādha was nullified."
