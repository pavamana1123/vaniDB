It is indicated herein that under such circumstances the temple doors should be closed. Only bona fide chanters should be admitted; others should not. But when there is large-scale congregational chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra, we keep our temples for everyone to join, and by the grace of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu this policy has given good results."
