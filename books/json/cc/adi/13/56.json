The same personality who was formerly the grandfather of Lord Kṛṣṇa appeared as Upendra Miśra at Śrīhaṭṭa and begot seven sons. He was a resident of Dhākā-dakṣiṇa-grāma in the district of Śrīhaṭṭa. There are still many residents of that part of the country who introduce themselves as belonging to the Miśra family of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu."
