Anyone who follows in the footsteps of Kavirāja Gosvāmī also accepts the lotus feet of the above-mentioned lords as his personal property. For a materialistic person, material wealth and opulence are only illusory. Actually they are not possessions but entanglements because by enjoying the material world a conditioned soul becomes more and more entangled by incurring debts for his present enjoyment. Unfortunately, a conditioned soul considers property for which he is in debt to be his own, and he is very busy acquiring such property. But a devotee considers such property not real property but simply an entanglement in the material world. If Lord Kṛṣṇa is very much pleased with a devotee, He takes away his material property, as stated in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (10.88.8), where Lord Kṛṣṇa says, yasyāham anugṛhṇāmi hariṣye tad-dhanaṁ śanaiḥ. \"To show special favor to a devotee, I take away all his material property.\" Similarly, Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says:"

Unfortunately we are interested in unreal property and are neglecting our real property (adhane yatana kari' dhana teyāginu)."
