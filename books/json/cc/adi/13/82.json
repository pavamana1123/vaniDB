A brāhmaṇa is always independent because he is a teacher, spiritual master and advisor to society. The members of society provide him with all the necessities for life. In the Bhagavad-gītā the Lord has divided society into four divisions-brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya and śūdra. A society cannot run smoothly without this scientific division. A brāhmaṇa should give good advice to all the members of the society, a kṣatriya should look after the administration, maintaining law and order in society, vaiśyas should produce and trade to meet all the needs of society, whereas śūdras should render service to the higher sections of society (the brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas and vaiśyas)."

			"content": "Jagannātha Miśra was a brāhmaṇa; therefore people would send him all bodily necessities-money, cloth, grain and so on. While Lord Caitanya was in the womb of Śacīmātā, Jagannātha Miśra received all these necessities of life without asking for them. Because of the presence of the Lord in his family, everyone offered him due respect as a brāhmaṇa. In other words, if a brāhmaṇa or Vaiṣṇava sticks to his position as an eternal servant of the Lord and executes the will of the Lord, there is no question of scarcity for his personal maintenance or the needs of his family."
