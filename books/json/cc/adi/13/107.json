	"synonyms": "kebā—who; āse—is coming; kebā—who; yāya—is going; kebā—who; nāce—is dancing; kebā—who; gāya—is singing; sambhālite—to understand; nāre—cannot; kāra—others; bola—language; khaṇḍileka—dissipated; duḥkha—unhappiness; śoka—lamentation; pramoda—jubilation; pūrita—full of; loka—all people; miśra—Jagannātha Miśra; hailā—became; ānande—in happiness; vihvala—overwhelmed.",
	"translation": "No one could understand who was coming and who was going, who was dancing and who was singing. Nor could they understand one another's language. Yet all unhappiness and lamentation were immediately dissipated, and people became all-jubilant. Thus Jagannātha Miśra was also overwhelmed with joy."
