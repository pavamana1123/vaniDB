Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura used to say, \"There is no scarcity of anything within this world. The only scarcity is of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\" That is the vision of all pure devotees. Because of this lack of Kṛṣṇa consciousness in human society, people are suffering terribly, being merged in an ocean of nescience and sense gratification. A devotee onlooker is very much aggrieved to see such a situation in the world."
