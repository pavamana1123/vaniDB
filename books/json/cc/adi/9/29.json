There is no distinction made between those who are fit and those who are not fit to hear or take part in the saṅkīrtana movement. It should therefore be preached without discrimination. The only purpose of the preachers of the saṅkīrtana movement must be to go on preaching without restriction. That is the way in which Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu introduced this saṅkīrtana movement to the world."
