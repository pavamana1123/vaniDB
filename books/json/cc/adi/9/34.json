Although He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He laments, \"How can I act alone? How can I alone pick the fruit and distribute it all over the world?\" This indicates that all classes of devotees should combine to distribute the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra without consideration of the time, place or situation."
