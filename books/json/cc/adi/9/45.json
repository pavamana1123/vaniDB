His saṅkīrtana movement is especially meant for the purpose of making people happy. He wanted to become the tree Himself because a tree is supposed to be the most benevolent living entity. In the following verse, which is from Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (10.22.33), Kṛṣṇa Himself highly praised the existence of a tree."
