When asked by Kṛṣṇa why she engaged in meditation with austerity, Lakṣmīdevī answered, \"I want to be one of Your associates like the gopīs in Vṛndāvana.\" Hearing this, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa replied that it was quite impossible. Lakṣmīdevī then said that she wanted to remain just like a golden line on the chest of the Lord. The Lord granted the request, and since then Lakṣmī has always been situated on the chest of Lord Kṛṣṇa as a golden line. The austerity and meditation of Lakṣmīdevī are also mentioned in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (10.16.36), where the Nāga-patnīs, the wives of the serpent Kāliya, in the course of their prayers to Kṛṣṇa, said that the goddess of fortune, Lakṣmī, also wanted His association as a gopī and desired the dust of His lotus feet."
