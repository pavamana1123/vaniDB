Since the plenary expansions exist within the original person, one may call Him by any of these names. In Śrī Caitanya-bhāgavata (Madhya 6.95) Lord Caitanya says, \"I was lying asleep in the ocean of milk, but I was awakened by the call of Nāḍā, Śrī Advaita Prabhu.\" Here the Lord refers to His form as Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu."
