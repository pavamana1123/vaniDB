			"content": "Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura describes Vīrabhadra Gosāñi as the direct son of Śrīla Nityānanda Prabhu and a disciple of Jāhnavā-devī. His real mother was Vasudhā. In the Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā, verse 67, he is mentioned as an incarnation of Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu. Therefore Vīrabhadra Gosāñi is nondifferent from Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu. In a village of the name Jhāmaṭapura, in the district of Hugali, Vīrabhadra Gosāñi had a disciple named Yadunāthācārya, who had two daughters-a real daughter named Śrīmatī and a foster daughter named Nārāyaṇī. Both these daughters married, and they are mentioned in Bhakti-ratnākara (Thirteenth Wave). Vīrabhadra Gosāñi had three disciples who are celebrated as his sons-Gopījana-vallabha, Rāmakṛṣṇa and Rāmacandra. The youngest, Rāmacandra, belonged to the Śāṇḍilya dynasty and had the surname Vaṭavyāla. He established his family at Khaḍadaha, and its members are known as the gosvāmīs of Khaḍadaha. The eldest disciple, Gopījana-vallabha, was a resident of a village known as Latā, near the Mānakara railway station in the district of Burdwan. The second, Rāmakṛṣṇa, lived near Māladaha, in a village named Gayeśapura. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura notes that since these three disciples belonged to different gotras, or dynasties, and also had different surnames and lived in different places, it is not possible to accept them as real sons of Vīrabhadra Gosāñi. Rāmacandra had four sons, of whom the eldest was Rādhāmādhava, whose third son was named Yādavendra. Yādavendra's son was Nandakiśora, his son was Nidhikṛṣṇa, his son was Caitanyacāṇḍa, his son was Kṛṣṇamohana, his son was Jaganmohana, his son was Vrajanātha, and his son was Śyāmalāla Gosvāmī. This is the genealogical table given by Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura for the descendants of Vīrabhadra Gosāñi."
