Sometimes people accept a man as God on the basis of their whimsical sentiments and without reference to the revealed scriptures, but the author of Caitanya-caritāmṛta proves all his statements by citing the śāstras. Thus he establishes that Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
