And among all the luminaries twinkling in the sky, the sun is the chief, and in the Brahma-saṁhitā the sun is accepted as the glowing effulgence of the Supreme Lord and is considered to be one of His eyes. Marīci is the controlling deity of the heavenly spaces. Among the stars, the moon is most prominent at night, and thus the moon represents Kṛṣṇa."
