			"content": "According to scriptural codes, a teacher who engages in an abominable action and has lost his sense of discrimination is fit to be abandoned.

Under the circumstances, they have lost the respectability of teachers. But Arjuna thinks that nevertheless they remain his superiors, and therefore to enjoy material profits after killing them would mean to enjoy spoils tainted with blood."
