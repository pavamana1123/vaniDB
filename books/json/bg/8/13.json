			"type": "normal",
			"content": "It is clearly stated here that om, Brahman, and Lord Kṛṣṇa are not different. The impersonal sound of Kṛṣṇa is om, but the sound Hare Kṛṣṇa contains om. It is clearly recommended in this age that if one quits his body at the end of this life chanting the mahāmantra, Hare Kṛṣṇa, he will reach the spiritual planets. Similarly, those who are devotees of Kṛṣṇa enter the Kṛṣṇa planet or Goloka Vṛndāvana, whereas the impersonalists remain in the brahmajyoti. The personalists also enter many innumerable planets in the spiritual sky known as Vaikuṇṭhas."
